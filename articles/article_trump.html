        <p><span class="firstLetter">T</span>his CARGC Paper identifies what <a href="#EarlKimport2014">Earl and Kimport (2014)</a> call the “repertoire of contention”
        for activists and protesters who speak out against immigration bans and an expanded <span class="keywords">wall</span>
        along the southern <span class="keywords">border</span> in the <span class="places">US</span>, as promised by <span class="people">President <span class="keywords">Trump</span></span> from the start of his
        <span class="event">presidential campaign in <span class="date">June 2015</span></span> through his first year in office. The paper asks: What tools
        are at hand for residents living on the <span class="places">US-Mexico <span class="keywords">border</span></span> to respond to mainstream news and
        presidential-driven narratives about immigrants, immigration, and the <span class="keywords">border</span> region? Likewise,
        how do citizen activists living far from the <span class="keywords">border</span> contend with <span class="people">President <span class="keywords">Trump</span></span>’s promises to
        “Build the <span class="keywords">wall</span>,” enact immigration bans, and deport the millions of undocumented immigrants
        living in the <span class="places">United States</span> (<a href="#Trump2015">Trump 2015</a>)? And critically, how do situated, highly localized pieces
        of <span class="keywords">street art</span> engage with new media to become creative and internationally resonant sites of
        defiance?</p>
        <p>To pursue these questions, this CARGC Paper examines <span class="keywords">street art</span> as a protest tactic in the
        <span class="keywords">border</span> region. For the purposes of this study, the practice of <span class="keywords">graffiti</span> and <span class="keywords">street art</span> is designated
        a political statement and here defined as a type of “mural painting, spray painting, wheatpasting/
        fly posting, freehand drawing and stenciling” (<a href="#Alviso-Marino2017">Alviso-Marino 2017</a>, 132) in public
        spaces. More specifically, they are non-commissioned drawings, text, or added materials on
        buildings or urban furniture (<a href="#Klaus2014">Klaus 2014</a>) visible to the public. Alternatively, commissioned
        murals in city spaces rely on third-party funding and government authorization to become
        fully realized, but in receiving government sanction may exchange a more resistive message
        for prominent space and visibility (<a href="Landry2017">Landry 2017</a>). The legal status of the art is as important as
        the spaces it inhabits and the shape it takes for extracting meaning. If art is state-sanctioned,
        questions arise over the legitimacy of its message. If it is illegal, <span class="keywords">street art</span> retains its counterauthority
        integrity. Additionally, by including references to people or ideas meaningful to a
        global community (e.g. world-renowned leaders, combatting racism, trending hashtags, meme
        references, and popular movies and TV shows), the practice of <span class="keywords">graffiti</span> and <span class="keywords">street art</span> on the
        <span class="keywords">border</span> maneuvers beyond local power dynamics to a production of generic symbols for wider
        audiences. <span class="keywords">Street art</span> produced on and near the <span class="keywords">border</span>, with a global and digital audience in
        mind, becomes an unlikely and imaginative new tactic in the “repertoire of contention” (<a href="#EarlKimport2014">Earl &
        Kimport 2014</a>).</p>
        <p><span class="keywords">Street art</span> is never politically neutral but carries a nature of subversive expression in response
        to some form of oppression (<a href="#Alviso-Marino2017">Alviso-Marino 2017</a>; <a href="#Landry2017">Landry 2017</a>; <a href="#Peteet1996">Peteet 1996</a>; <a href="#Leventis2017">Leventis 2017</a>;
        <a href="#MacDowell2017">MacDowell 2017</a>). Repurposing the <span class="keywords">border</span> <span class="keywords">wall</span> and subverting its meaning becomes a primary
        concern of messages created on or near the <span class="keywords">wall</span>. Commercial interests, for instance, contribute
        to the <span class="keywords">wall</span>’s shifting function between international <span class="keywords">border</span> and a highly visible canvas for
        advertising. <a href="#Madsen2015">Madsen (2015)</a> examines the use of the <span class="keywords">border</span> <span class="keywords">wall</span> as a place for illegally painted
        marketing messages by local businesses, and the <span class="keywords">wall</span>’s significance regarding the impact of
        international forces on local communities. While painting advertisements in high-traffic areas
        on the <span class="keywords">border</span> <span class="keywords">wall</span> may be a matter of convenience over confrontation, Madsen points out that
        the repurposing of the <span class="keywords">wall</span> in this way is a refusal “to give the fence legitimacy” (110): a key
        theme for other non-commercial <span class="keywords">street art</span> on the <span class="keywords">border</span> <span class="keywords">wall</span>. By altering the meaning of a
        publicly-situated object, building, or <span class="keywords">wall</span>, <span class="keywords">street art</span> is inherently a reclamation of autonomy and
        a rebuttal to dominance.</p>
        <p>At its essence, <span class="keywords">street art</span> is an assertive counteraction within a larger, infrastructural power
        scheme. Describing the use of <span class="keywords">street art</span> for activist purposes in <span class="places">Yemen</span>, Alviso-Marino (2017)
        names the art itself as a “sensitizing device for political awareness” (130) that is situated at
        “the intersections of space, contentious politics, and artistic practices” (124). Reflective of
        local power dynamics in the public sphere, <a href="#Peteet1996">Peteet (1996)</a> explains it as a cultural production
        during political contest, a means of resistance, and a rite of passage into tactics of activism.
        <span class="keywords">Street art</span> both assumes and fashions its audience and critically, it is “contextualized in sets
        of power relations…in spaces where competing, yet highly unbalanced, systems of power
        interface and meaning [is] constructed…, constituting a voice for those who have felt voiceless
        in the international arena” (<a href="#Peteet1996">Peteet 1996</a>, 145-155). Visual expressions of art on the street are
        necessarily comingled with the political public sphere where they are placed and can only be
        understood in the context of the culture and power in which they are asserted.</p>

        <h3 class="mt-3 index">THE POLITICAL CLIMATE OF 2016 & ANTI-TRUMP STREET ART</h3>
        <p><span class="firstLetter">F</span>rom his <span class="event">announcement of candidacy in <span class="date">June 2015</span></span>, to <span class="event">his inauguration on <span class="date">January 20,
        2017</span></span>, and throughout his first year in office, <span class="people">President <span class="keywords">Trump</span></span>’s rhetoric and enacted policies
        regarding <span class="keywords">border</span> security and immigration were a linchpin for protests around the country. At
        his candidacy announcement speech, <span class="keywords">Trump</span> made promises that were repeated throughout
        his campaign: “I would build a great <span class="keywords">wall</span>, and nobody builds <span class="keywords">wall</span>s better than me, believe
        me, and I’ll build them very inexpensively, I will build a great, great <span class="keywords">wall</span> on our southern
        <span class="keywords">border</span>. And I will have <span class="keywords places">Mexico</span> pay for that <span class="keywords">wall</span>. Mark my words” (<a href="#Trump2015">Trump 2015</a>). Statements
        like these fueled his campaign, mobilized his support base—even leading to popular chants
        at his campaign rallies to “Build the <span class="keywords">wall</span>!”—and marked him at the center of a media
        craze throughout <span class="date">2016</span>. Seven days after he was inaugurated, <span class="event"><span class="people">President <span class="keywords">Trump</span></span> signed an
        executive order that barred admission of all people arriving to the <span class="places">US</span> from seven Middle
        Eastern countries</span>. On <span class="date">September 5, 2017</span> <span class="event"><span class="keywords">Trump</span> indicated he would end Deferred Action
        for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA (sometimes referred to as the Dream Act), the Obama-era
        policy, unless Congress replaced it</span>. This decision prompted marches around the country and
        the uptick in hashtags such as <span class="hashtags">#DefendDACA</span>, <span class="hashtags">#Dreamer</span>, <span class="hashtags">#DefendDreamers</span>, <span class="hashtags">#DACA</span>, and
        <span class="hashtags">#NoBanNoWall</span> (<a href="#Sweet2017">Sweet 2017</a>; <a href="#Shear2017">Shear and Hirschfield Davis 2017</a>; McGraw, Kelsey, and
        Keneally 2017). The <span class="keywords">border</span> region continues to be a target of <span class="keywords">Trump</span>’s rhetoric and policies,
        and has subsequently become a concentrated site of anti-<span class="keywords">Trump</span> and anti-<span class="keywords">border</span> <span class="keywords">wall</span> <span class="keywords">street art</span>.</p>
        <p>Anti-<span class="keywords">Trump</span> <span class="keywords">street art</span> has been observed all over the world since the beginning of <span class="event">the <span class="date">2016</span>
        presidential campaign</span>, three examples of which are shown in <a href="#fig123">Figures 1</a>, <a href="#fig123">2</a> and <a href="#fig123">3</a>. A collection
        of sixty-five anti-<span class="keywords">Trump</span> <span class="keywords">street art</span> pieces in The Huffington Post (<a href="#Moran2017">Moran 2017</a>) lists the wide
        range of locations around the globe anti-<span class="keywords">Trump</span> sentiment has found a public audience.
        Across <span class="places">North America</span>, <span class="places">South America</span>, <span class="places">Europe</span>, <span class="places">Australia</span>, the <span class="places">Middle East</span> and <span class="places">Asia</span>, as well
        as on social media platforms like Twitter and Instagram, <span class="keywords">Trump</span>’s likeness has popped up on
        urban furniture and in the digital public in subversive forms. The majority of the images in the
        compilation, when shared on social media, were accompanied with hashtags such as <span class="hashtags">#trump</span>,
        <span class="hashtags">#donaldtrump</span>, <span class="hashtags">#dumptrump</span>, <span class="hashtags">#drumpf</span>, <span class="hashtags">#alleyart</span>, <span class="hashtags">#streetart</span>, <span class="hashtags">#antitrumpstreetart</span>, <span class="hashtags">#icanteven</span>,

        <span class="hashtags">#makeamericagreatagain</span>, and <span class="hashtags">#makeamericamexicoagain</span>. By accompanying these images
        with one or more hashtags, the artists—or social media users who discovered the art on the
        street—invite the viewer to continue their engagement with the art online. <a href="#fig123">Figures 1</a>, <a href="#fig123">2</a>, and <a href="#fig123">3</a>
        demonstrate the tactic used by street artists of combining locally significant, globally resonant
        pop culture figures and themes into messages that are meaningful to more people. The <span class="keywords">street art</span>
        found on the <span class="keywords">border</span> also uses this tactic.</p>

        <p>In light of <span class="people">Donald <span class="keywords">Trump</span></span>’s rhetoric in the media about the <span class="keywords">border</span> region, immigrants, and
        immigration, this paper aims to investigate how <span class="keywords">street art</span> situated on or near the <span class="keywords">border</span>
        acknowledges and responds to that rhetoric. <span class="keywords">Trump</span>’s rhetoric during his historic candidacy
        prompted creative resistance all over the world, but how does creative resistance take shape
        in the region that was a central focus of his campaign? This study aims to build on literature that
        valorizes the practice of political <span class="keywords">street art</span> as a legitimate voice in the public forum (<a href="#Kraidy2017">Kraidy and
        Krikorian 2017</a>; <a href="MacDowell2018">MacDowell 2018</a>; <a href="Poell2013">Poell 2013</a>) while determining how artists create <span class="keywords">street art</span>
        that resonates with global and digital audiences, and engages them in a counter narrative to
        mainstream media.</p>

        <h3 class="mt-3 index">METHODOLOGY</h3>
        <p><span class="firstLetter">T</span>his CARGC Paper is a textual analysis of <span class="keywords">street art</span> in the <span class="keywords">border</span> region about immigrant
        portrayals, the <span class="keywords">border</span> <span class="keywords">wall</span>'s presence in local communities, and <span class="people">Donald <span class="keywords">Trump</span></span>. While negative,
        derogatory, or simplified depictions and narratives about immigrants and the <span class="keywords">border</span> region
        have existed in mainstream media for some time, the data collection in this study specifically
        focuses on found <span class="keywords">street art</span> or text that rebutted those narratives, were incited by statements
        from <span class="people">Donald <span class="keywords">Trump</span></span>, or depicted <span class="keywords">Trump</span> directly. Images of art works were also collected to
        provide context as well as contrast the narratives around <span class="keywords">Trump</span> and his policies. The result is
        two interrelated themes of <span class="keywords">street art</span> collected as a sample for analysis: <span class="keywords">street art</span> or text about
        immigration and the <span class="keywords">border</span> region, and <span class="keywords">street art</span> or text about <span class="people">Donald <span class="keywords">Trump</span></span>.</p>
        <p>To gather a collection of images for this analysis, I investigated two arenas. The first was on
        the <span class="keywords">border</span> <span class="keywords">wall</span> or in the immediate vicinity of the two largest <span class="keywords">border</span> crossings: <span class="places">San Ysidro,
        California</span>, and <span class="places">El Paso, Texas</span>. The <span class="places">San Ysidro</span> crossing in Southern California, which connects
        <span class="places">Tijuana</span>, <span class="keywords">Mexico</span> to the greater <span class="places">San Diego</span>, CA area, and the El Paso crossing between <span class="places">El Paso,
        Texas</span> and <span class="places">Ciudad Juárez, <span class="keywords">Mexico</span></span> are the two busiest points of entry for the entire <span class="keywords">border</span>.
        They each average upwards of 30 million people per year entering into the <span class="places">United States</span> by
        vehicle or on foot (<a href="#USDepartmentofTransportation2017">US Department of Transportation 2017</a>). By travelling to these two <span class="keywords">border</span>
        communities and surveying for <span class="keywords">street art</span> on the <span class="keywords">border</span> wall, near the crossings in high-traffic
        areas, and in highly visibly and locally significant spaces within the city limits, I found multiple
        concentrated sites of <span class="keywords">street art</span> about immigration, the <span class="keywords">border</span> region and <span class="keywords">Trump</span>.</p>
        <p>The second arena I explored was social media, in particular Instagram and Twitter. When
        searching for <span class="keywords">Trump</span>-related <span class="keywords">street art</span> more broadly, I discovered numerous hashtags as
        part of captions that accompanied <span class="keywords">street art</span> images of <span class="keywords">Trump</span>, or the text of the hashtags
        were embedded in the actual image itself (<a href="#Moran2017">Moran 2017</a>). I conducted the search using the
        search functions on both Instagram and Twitter, with combinations of the following hashtags:
        <span class="hashtags">#TrumpStreetArt</span>, <span class="hashtags">#FuckTrump</span>, <span class="hashtags">#DumpTrump</span>, <span class="hashtags">#StreetArt</span>, <span class="hashtags">#NoBanNoWall</span>, <span class="hashtags">#DefendDreamers</span>,
        and <span class="hashtags">#DefendDACA</span>. From this search, I discovered a curated site of dozens of Dreamer and
        DACA-themed <span class="keywords">street art</span> pieces in <span class="places">Long Beach, California</span>, 130 miles north of the <span class="keywords">border</span>, and
        25 miles south of downtown <span class="places">Los Angeles</span>. Although much further from the <span class="keywords">border</span> than the other
        <span class="keywords">street art</span> found near the <span class="places">San Ysidro, California</span> and <span class="places">El Paso, Texas</span> <span class="keywords">border</span> crossings, this site has
        <span class="keywords">street art</span> with content thematically relevant to the research questions in this study, and the county
        in which it is situated is home to an estimated 814,000 undocumented immigrants (<a href="#HayesHill2017">Hayes and
        Hill 2017</a>).</p>

        <h3 class="mt-3 index">SEGUNDO BARRIO: EL PASO, TEXAS</h3>
        <p><span class="firstLetter">T</span>he five images selected as a sample from El Paso's 
        <span class="keywords">street art</span> scene demonstrate the kinds of portraits and styles
        readily visible throughout the city, and particularly in
        <span class="places">Segundo Barrio</span>. They were selected because of their
        close proximity to the <span class="keywords">border</span> (all were less than a mile
        away from the <span class="keywords">border</span> <span class="keywords">wall</span>) and because they represent
        the range of human depictions in the neighborhood,
        which contrast starkly with the two depictions of <span class="keywords">Trump</span>
        found in the area.</p>
        <p>
            <a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a> is a stenciled, spray-painted portrait of 
            <span class="people murales">Benito Juárez</span>, president of <span class="keywords places">Mexico</span> from 1857 until his death
            in 1872. Placed on the <span class="keywords">wall</span> on the east side of the
            convention center between downtown and Segundo Barrio, his portrait is framed with his most famous
            phrase: “El respeto al derecho ajeno es la paz,” which translates to “Respect for the rights of others is peace.”
            Formerly a governor of the majority indigenous southern Mexican state of Oaxaca, and of indigenous heritage
            himself, he remains a symbol of Mexican nationalism, a local historical hero and stalwart figure against
            foreign intervention. Ciudad Juárez is his namesake. The stenciled image of him is based on black and white
            historical photographs, though it is “colorized” by paint. His official portrait as president lives on as a signifier of
            <span class="keywords places">Mexico</span>’s autonomy and triumph over foreign threats, and his likeness is a reaffirmation of <span class="keywords places">Mexico</span>’s dignity
            as a diverse nation (a mestizaje or culture of mixed ancestries).

            Her facial features, dark hair, and regionally traditional garb suggests she is of some indigenous
            heritage, and her expression is exuberantly carefree. Because her eyes are closed, she neither looks back at
            the viewer nor her surroundings, and she is completely absorbed in her happiness, high above the pedestrian
            viewer. The immediate connotation of a young girl with a halo shape around her head parallels images of <span class="murales">Virgin Mary</span> (see <a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>) seen throughout the neighborhood.

        Within <span class="places">Segundo Barrio</span> and throughout <span class="keywords places">Mexico</span> the icon of the <span class="murales">Virgin Mary</span> is a pervasive image
        in public and private spaces, and is a reminder of the Catholic Church’s influence in Mexican
        culture. The figure in this painting strongly alludes to a Catholic-style icon. Her head is framed
        by the short brim of her sombrero with alternating bands of white and black, which is identical in
        shape to the halos framing the heads in icon images of Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mary and angels.
        Unlike the Virgin Mary, who is usually looking down and to the side, this figure faces upwards,
        an expected expression of sorrow turned into one of unbridled joy. The text next the girl’s face
        which has since been incompletely painted over reads “Liberation is not white.”

        <p>About one mile to the north of the <span class="murales">Benito Juárez</span> and <span class="murales">Laughing Girl</span> figures, the largest piece
        of <span class="keywords">street art</span> in <span class="places">Segundo Barrio</span> (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>) appears on a side street mixed with residences and
        small businesses. It is situated on the side of long, one story building in front of an empty field. 
        A young boy is depicted lying down dead on his stomach and side.</p>

                children in the area. Note pedestrian at bottom right for scale.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>The figure is comprised of neutral colors—the colors of the surrounding landscape—and despite
            its size, it is easy to miss. The child is painted in muted colors, facing away from the viewer, and
            shoeless, he wears socks with holes in them. The color palette of variations on grey, together
            with his face hidden from the viewer, indicate a subject to be overlooked. What is remarkable
            about this image is the scale of the child. The size certainly makes it the biggest painting
            encountered, as it takes up roughly one residential block (note the pedestrian walking on the
            bottom right of the image for a scale comparison). The colors and posture of the figure indicate
            immobility and death. The scale of the painting, however, declares the subject’s presence and
            death simultaneously, and reminds the viewer of <span class="people">Alan Kurdi</span>, the Syrian toddler who drowned
            in the Mediterranean as he and his family attempted to reach Europe. Furthermore, because
            the child’s face is not showing, it can be assumed that the central subject of the painting is not
            necessarily an identified person’s life lost, but an enlargement of lives lost more generally, in
            ways that are distinct to the <span class="keywords">border</span> region: migrants who have died by border agent gunfire or
            by the elements in the desert attempting to cross in to the <span class="places">US</span> long before they reach the <span class="keywords">border</span>.</p>
        <p><a href="#fig8">Figure 8</a> is the final piece of the sample of contextual art in and around <span class="places">Segundo Barrio</span> and,
            like the <span class="murales">Boy Lying Dead</span> in <a href="fig7">Figure 7</a>, is enormous in scale, yet made up of several smaller figures,
            text, and motifs. Painted on the side of a building on the edge of Segundo Barrio—a stone’s
            throw away from the Rio Grande and the <span class="keywords">border</span>—a warehouse <span class="keywords">wall</span> is made up entirely of blue
            <span class="keywords">graffiti</span> text (probably names of artists, though illegible to me) and images of human-like figures,
            dressed in Chicano-style street clothes, with green skin, and “alien” teardrop shaped heads. The
            paintings and surrounding text are highly detailed, brightly colored works in spray paint, but the
            most notable theme in this piece is the alien motif of the figures.</p>
        <div class="img_article" id="fig8"><div class="art-deco-image"><img src="../images/aliens.png"></div>

                <em>Figure 8</em>. <span class="murales">Borderland Aliens</span>. A rerouting of the term “illegal alien” so often applied to <span class="people">Latinos</span> of
                color, especially in the <span class="keywords">border</span> region.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>The figures are a clear play on the “illegal alien” label. The artist(s) embrace, self-deprecate,
            and reclaim the often-derogatory term in an inventive and entertaining jest. The entire piece
            serves as an articulation of everyday Chicano culture (particularly in the attire and car choice),
            a nod to wider stereotypes about <span class="people">Latinos</span>, and an affirmation of the humanity of <span class="people">Latinos</span> in the
            <span class="keywords">border</span> region. The political-cultural context in which the piece was created exists as a reminder
            of how having brown skin equates to a suspicion of illegality, and this alien painting responds to
            and turns those assumptions on their heads. The larger theme of the alien painting is that <span class="people">Latinos</span>
            in the <span class="keywords">border</span> region know, in their everyday lives, they are culturally and politically suspected
            to be illegal solely by their race, culture and very presence in the <span class="places">United States</span>. The artists not
            only know they are labeled as such, but reroute the label as one inherent to their identity as
            an “othered” and suspected race. The figures look neutrally at and greet the viewer, express
            themselves with understated signifiers of Latino and Chicano culture, and reaffirm their presence.

            <a href="#fig9">Figure 9</a> features one of two depictions of <span class="keywords">Trump</span> found together on the El Paso side of the
            <span class="keywords">border</span> in <span class="places">Segundo Barrio</span>, and it is rich in detail. The figure has yellow-orange hair in <span class="keywords">Trump</span>’s
            signature swooshed coif, the skin is light pink suggesting the figure is Caucasian, and the eyes,
            encased in two thick eyelids and without eyebrows or eyelashes, are a light blue color. The face
            is finished out with oddly-shaped bulging cheeks, one visible pig’s ear jutting out at an angle
            from beside the eyes, a few warts at the base of the ear, a large wrinkled snout topped with its
            own small swoosh of yellow-orange hair, colorless human-style lips resting in a small frown,
            and a low-hanging, shadowy set of skin folds below the chin and continues to where the head
            meets the rest of the body. The end of the body is rounded out with two bare buttocks and a
            short, curled tail.

            This portrayal of <span class="people">Donald <span class="keywords">Trump</span></span> evokes pure revulsion. Physically, everything from the
            exaggerated crack on his behind to the loose, wrinkled skin hanging from his neck emphasize a
            creature meant to be disgusting to look at and easy to laugh at. Between the neck and the rear
            end, it is like the viewer has caught <span class="keywords">Trump</span> with his pants down, and indeed, this pig wears no
            pants. The color of the skin is pink, as some pigs are, but the artist cleverly altered the skin color
            depending on the part of the body. Around the nose/snout, eyes, and most clearly under the
            chin, the skin becomes a sicklier, greyish pink. On the rump, the skin is bright and vividly pink,
            reminding the viewer to not overlook the fact the president is half naked. The transformation of
            <span class="keywords">Trump</span> into a pig forms a brilliant caricature: one that invites a mocking reaction from the viewer.

        <p>
            <a href="#fig10">Figure 10</a>, situated in a similarly-sized line of <span class="keywords">graffiti</span> text just below the <span class="murales"><span class="keywords">Trump</span>pig art</span>

            Egg yolk, either ingeniously or conveniently color matched to

            on Twitter to rouse support with his base and reiterate his

        <h3 class="mt-3 index">THE CEMENT CULVERT: CIUDAD JUÁREZ, <span class="keywords places">MEXICO</span></h3>
        <p>
            <span class="firstLetter">O</span>n the Mexican side of the <span class="keywords">border</span> in the <span class="places">cement culvert</span> running beneath the two main
            international <span class="keywords">border</span> crossings, I observed scores of text and drawings written and drawn on
            the cement. The culvert leading down to the water has wide flat areas and steeply angled walls
            that display most of the drawings and writings visible to the pedestrians passing overhead on
            the bridges. The highest concentrations of <span class="keywords">street art</span> I found were directly underneath the bridges,
            and drawings and text often overlapped with each other, competing for space. I selected
            the text and artwork here as samples from this site because they were the most prominently
            visible, without many surrounding pieces distracting from them, and are probably seen and
            noticed most frequently by pedestrians. I also included two large portraits of famous political
            figures—one of <span class="people">Che Guevara</span> and one of <span class="people">Nelson Mandela</span>—not only because they were highly
            visible underneath the bridges, but also because they (like <span class="people">Benito Juárez</span> of <a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a> in <span class="places">El Paso</span>)
            contrast starkly with the two portrayals of <span class="people">Donald <span class="keywords">Trump</span></span> found in the culvert.

            Prominent and powerful statements regarding immigration and the <span class="keywords">border</span> <span class="keywords">wall</span> appear in this

            top of the culvert in red paint with the Santa Fe Street Bridge in the background above it. “La
            migra” is a slang term in Spanish broadly used for <span class="keywords">border</span> patrol and Immigration and Customs
            Enforcement (ICE) officers. Further down the culvert is a large rectangular block, painted in
            blue, with the text “Berlin <span class="keywords">Wall</span>” painted in white letters outlined in black. The bold lettering
            spans the height of the angled <span class="keywords">wall</span> in the culvert and is nearly twenty feet high.

            Aside from a mural featuring <span class="people">Donald <span class="keywords">Trump</span></span> and Mexican President <span class="people">Enrique Peña Nieto</span> 
            (<a href="#fig16">Figure 16</a>), I observed only two other large-scale portraits of humans (greater than two to three feet)
            in the culvert: those of <span class="people">Nelson Mandela</span> and <span class="people">Che Guevara</span>. The painting of the South African
            president who led the charge against apartheid is painted in great detail, favorably presents
            Mandela, and is prominently visible from the crossing bridge above. His head is the only part
            of his body shown and he is depicted with a wide smile, looking directly at the viewer. A leftist
            revolutionary, central figure to the <span class="event">Cuban Revolution</span>, and martyred hero and icon of socialism,
            <span class="people">Ernesto “Che” Guevara</span>’s famous visage is painted beneath the <span class="keywords">border</span> crossing bridge, accompanied with text to the left of his head, “Viva Cuba!” and text to the right which reads
            “a 50 años to ejemplo sigue vivo,” translated as “for 50 years your example is still alive.” The
            portrait is inspired by a widely replicated photograph of him, which has become a symbol of
            revolution, and shows only his head as he looks up and away, wearing his Basque style hat,
            with his face framed by his long hair.
        </p>
        <p>
            In contrast to the <span class="murales">portraits of Guevara and Mandela</span>, two separate large pieces in the culvert
            show <span class="people">Donald <span class="keywords">Trump</span></span>. The first is done in chalk, and includes the text “He is fucking the world.”
            The figure of <span class="keywords">Trump</span> is shown on his knees holding his penis, which is pointed towards a globe.
            The entire drawing is done simply: <span class="keywords">Trump</span>’s body and hair is outlined in white chalk, his face is
            outlined in black, and he is given blue eyes, a red mouth, and red tie. In front of him is a blue

            striped blue and white socks, a blue suit with shortened legs and sleeves, and a white dress shirt
            with a blue tie. His yellow-orange hair is curled into an enormous spiral atop one side of his
            head, and on the other side sits a Mickey Mouse hat at a slant. He holds a bricklayer’s trowel
            in his right hand while his left hand places a brick with the word “<span class="keywords places">Mexico</span>” written on it onto a
            partially built <span class="keywords">wall</span>. Across the painted <span class="keywords">wall</span> from him is Mexican President <span class="people">Enrique Peña Nieto</span>
            who also holds a trowel pointed towards his own face (the tip appears to be covered in blood).
            He is dressed in a black suit jacket, white dress shirt and tie, and a white apron synched at the
            waist and lined with frills at the bottom. The apron falls to the length of his upper thighs, where
            beyond that only bare legs are shown from his thighs downward. One hand holds the trowel
            while the other hand (also seemingly covered in blood) is gripping the partially built <span class="keywords">wall</span>. Peña
            Nieto’s mouth is covered in grey tape. Finally, in between the two figures is a rough outline of a

            Though the renown of <span class="keywords">Trump</span>, <span class="people">Mandela</span> and <span class="people">Guevara</span> is arguably equal, the judgements passed
            by the artists’ depictions of the three leaders in the <span class="keywords">border</span> culvert contrast starkly with each
            other. The <span class="keywords">street art</span> on both sides of the <span class="keywords">border</span> in the El Paso-Juárez community is in agreement
            about who is to be admired and who is to be mocked. The <span class="murales">Mandela and Guevara images</span> are
            not too distant in style from the portraits found a mile away in <span class="places">El Paso</span>. Dignified, stately, and
            empowered, the <span class="murales">faces of Mandela and Guevara</span> recall courage and victory over racism, like
            the <span class="murales">Laughing Girl</span> (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>), and resistance to foreign intervention, like <span class="murales">Benito Juárez</span> 
            (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>). In a similar fashion, the enormous scale of <span class="murales">SpongeBob <span class="keywords">Trump</span></span> infantilizes him as an idiot
            cartoon, like <span class="murales">Humpty Dumpty <span class="keywords">Trump</span></span> (<a href="#fig10">Figure 10</a>), and invites mockery and disgust as he’s caught
            with his pants down in <span class="murales">Chalk <span class="keywords">Trump</span></span> (<a href="#fig15">Figure 15</a>) and <span class="murales">Pig <span class="keywords">Trump</span></span> (<a href="#fig9">Figure 9</a>).
            The content of <span class="murales">Chalk <span class="keywords">Trump</span></span> takes it a step further and portrays <span class="keywords">Trump</span> as a vulgar aggressor. In this piece, the artist
            responds to <span class="keywords">Trump</span>’s rhetoric with an explicit message: <span class="keywords">Trump</span> isn’t just drawn assaulting <span class="keywords places">Mexico</span>
            or the borderlands, but the world.

        <h3 class="mt-3 index">THE LARGEST BORDER CROSSING: SAN YSIDRO, CALIFORNIA</h3>
        <p><span class="firstLetter">O</span>n the US side of the <span class="places">San Ysidro, California</span> <span class="keywords">border</span> crossing, I found no <span class="keywords">street art</span>.
        Infrastructurally, in San Ysidro, as with El Paso on the US side, it was difficult, if not impossible, to
        get close to the <span class="keywords">border</span> <span class="keywords">wall</span>. It was usually behind a stretch of land, several dozen yards deep
        that had “Restricted Access” signs in red lettering around it. Additionally, running immediately
        adjacent to the <span class="keywords">border</span> <span class="keywords">wall</span> was often a paved road used for <span class="keywords">border</span> patrol vehicles, and
        therefore obstructed from public use, which would explain why no art was found on the US side of the <span class="keywords">border</span>.</p>
        <p>At the <span class="keywords">border</span> Field State Park, where the <span class="keywords">border</span> <span class="keywords">wall</span> meets the Pacific Ocean on the American
        side, visitors can go directly up to the <span class="keywords">border</span> <span class="keywords">wall</span> in a stretch of about 100 yards and speak
        with people on the other side of the <span class="keywords">border</span> in <span class="places">Playas de Tijuana</span>. However, the beach is not
        easily accessible. Just above the beach is a lookout and picnic area with a flat lawn, facilities,
        and some benches and tables. <span class="keywords">Border</span> patrol agents are stationed a few yards away monitoring
        the beach and the park, and as with other areas around <span class="places">San Ysidro</span>, visitors are not allowed to
        get close to the <span class="keywords">border</span> fence. Overall, the <span class="keywords">border</span> area on the US side is designed to discourage
        or outright forbid visitors from approaching or going near the <span class="keywords">border</span> fence, so even if there was
        art or text on the <span class="keywords">wall</span>, it would be visible to very few.</p>

        <span class="places">Playas de Tijuana</span>, the public access beach area where the <span class="keywords">border</span> fence meets the Pacific Ocean,
        and a little tourist spot with meandering food vendors, mariachi bands, and souvenir stands.
        There is a small park with benches, picnic tables, and a lookout for people to see up and down
        the beach. The <span class="keywords">border</span> fence at <span class="places">Playas de Tijuana</span> was nearly completely covered in text and
        drawings. Listed here are some examples of repeated ideas, phrases, and themes seen up and

            <a href="#fig17">Figure 17</a> shows mostly text spots on the <span class="keywords">wall</span> that share messages of unity and anti-wall
            declarations. The six examples from the compilation in <a href="#fig17">Figure 17</a> say, from left to right, say
            “Somos America” (“We are America”), “Tear down the <span class="keywords">wall</span>,” “El arte es una extensión de

            Four larger drawings from the Tijuana sample demonstrate US-Mexico relations, immigration,
            the restrictive nature of the <span class="keywords">border</span> <span class="keywords">wall</span>, and <span class="keywords">Trump</span>. <a href="#fig1819">Figure 18</a> is a large and detailed painting
            of a <span class="murales">monarch butterfly</span> sitting atop red flower. Monarch butterflies are graceful symbols of
            migration for Mexicans. The monarch butterfly species, distinct for its vibrant orange and black
            pattern on its wings, lives all over the American Midwest and central Canada, and each year
            completes a migration south over thousands of miles back to several exact spots in <span class="keywords places">Mexico</span>
            (most famously and in highest numbers in the state of Michoacán), which are dedicated
            protected reserves for the monarchs. <a href="#fig1819">Figure 19</a> shows two interlocking fingertips at the top
            portion of the <span class="keywords">wall</span>, while the bottom portion is a simple graphic of two overlapping hearts on
            a white background. For family members who are separated by the <span class="keywords">wall</span> and do not have the
            freedom to travel back and forth across the countries’ <span class="keywords">border</span>, they will meet at the <span class="keywords">border</span> fence,

            <span class="murales">Love Trumps Hate</span> (<a href="#fig20">Figure 20</a>) features a hybrid flag, made of a fusion between the US and
            Mexican flags. The text written on the flags says “Love Trumps Hate” on the US portion of the flag and the Spanish version of the same phrase, “El amor vence al odio” on the Mexican
            portion of the flag. This is the only image I found at the <span class="places">Playas de Tijuana</span> site that contained a
            reference to <span class="keywords">Trump</span>. While an explicit mention of <span class="keywords">Trump</span>, the phrase “Love Trumps Hate” became
            a popular chant at protest marches after the election, a prominent hashtag on social media, and a concise play on <span class="keywords">Trump</span>’s name, rerouting
            the figure of <span class="keywords">Trump</span> for those that oppose him to something positive. Messages of unity,
            brotherhood, and love painted on the <span class="keywords">wall</span> at this site follows the trend of <span class="keywords">street art</span>’s purpose along
            the <span class="keywords">border</span> is to reroute, subvert, respond, and transform.

        <p>The second site of data collection in Tijuana, <span class="places">Colonia Libertad</span>, is a very modest neighborhood that abuts the <span class="keywords">border</span> <span class="keywords">wall</span>, east of the San Ysidro
            crossing. The roads are either paved or very rough dirt and gravel. The <span class="keywords">border</span> <span class="keywords">wall</span> in this neighborhood became the site for an anti-<span class="keywords">Trump</span> mural which received a great deal of attention in the local press (see <a href="#fig22">Figure 22</a>). Only one of
            the two <span class="keywords">Trump</span> murals selected here was still visible in <span class="places">Tijuana</span> as of <span class="date">February 2018</span>. <a href="#fig21">Figure 21</a>
            shows a section of the <span class="keywords">wall</span> where a grey block of paint covers the <span class="keywords">wall</span>, and what could have been the site of the “<span class="murales">Rape <span class="keywords">Trump</span></span>” mural in 
            <a href="#fig22">Figure 22</a>. Several pieces of writing are concentrated there, including the words “Fuck <span class="keywords">Trump</span>” in black spray paint with a yellow arrow underneath it.
            <a href="#fig22">Figure 22</a> is a large mural done by the <span class="people"><span class="keywords">street art</span> collective Indecline</span>. <span class="keywords">Trump</span> is set against a
            white background and smaller black text on the lower portion of the mural reads in Spanish
            as directions to <span class="keywords">Trump</span> Tower in New York City from that specific spot. The mural is flanked by
            two painted ladders drawn to look like they arem propped against the <span class="keywords">wall</span>. The painting may have
            been done sometime in <span class="date">2016</span>, but as of <span class="date">February 2018</span> was no longer visible and was probably painted over with grey paint.</p>

        <p>This mural is as graphically explicit as <span class="murales">Chalk <span class="keywords">Trump</span></span> in <span class="places">Juárez</span> (<a href="#fig15">Figure 15</a>), and is certainly the
            most prominent controversial piece. <span class="keywords">Trump</span> is postured after a widely disseminated photograph
            of him during one of his speeches (<a href="#fig23">Figure 23</a> also uses the same pose of <span class="people">Donald <span class="keywords">Trump</span></span>) and
            what is stunning about this mural is the sexually graphic and violent nature of the content. The
            mural commands the viewer to sexually assault a presidential candidate, then gives directions to his house. As if the text was not graphic enough, the presence of a brightly colored ball gag
            drives home the taboo. This piece of <span class="keywords">street art</span> was drawn in direct response to <span class="keywords">Trump</span> calling
            Mexican immigrants rapists. It reverses the label of rapist and takes it to the next level. Put another way, the mural communicates a primitive ultimatum: it retaliates for being called rapists by rhetorically promising rape to the name-caller.
        </p>
        <p>
            The last significant piece of <span class="keywords">street art</span> I found in <span class="places">Tijuana</span> is 
            a mural of <span class="murales">four women painted alongside <span class="keywords">Trump</span></span>, who is posed in the same way as he is in <a href="#fig22">Figure 22</a>. The painting is by a local
            muralist named <span class="people">Mode Orozco</span>, who, as far as could be investigated, was not commissioned
            to complete it (<a href="#Rowe2016">Rowe 2016</a>). It depicts, from left to right, <span class="people">Donald <span class="keywords">Trump</span></span>, a Syrian woman, a
            Chinese woman, a Guatemalan woman, and a Mexican woman with their respective countries’ flags filling up the background. The mural is painted on the side of houses in front of an empty
            field that runs alongside a main arterial road through Tijuana that leads to the Otay <span class="keywords">border</span>
            crossing, about one mile north of the painting. Above the artists’ name reads larger text in red lettering: “Todos Somos Migrantes” or “We are all migrants.”

            This immense mural touches on several themes relevant to the local community of Tijuana, but like the political figures in the <span class="places">cement culvert of Juárez</span>, they also reach outward to resonate
            globally. Butterflies, as a favorable metaphor for migration, again make an appearance and situate the subject matter as an alternative perspective on immigration and the migrant
            experience. The halo again makes an appearance (like <span class="murales">Laughing Girl</span> in <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>) around the
            Mexican woman’s head. The artist’s decision to portray four female immigrants situated above <span class="people">Donald <span class="keywords">Trump</span></span> in eloquent, beautiful and dignified poses further reacts to the pervasive ordering
            of society <span class="people">Donald <span class="keywords">Trump</span></span> would seem to prescribe, one aspect of which is the acceptance
            and normalizing of “locker room talk.” This mural reaches beyond <span class="keywords">Trump</span>’s effect on the local community and calls for a dignification of women of color from around the world.

        <h3 class="mt-3 index">THE DREAMERS TUNNEL: LONG BEACH, CALIFORNIA</h3>
        <p><span class="firstLetter">A</span>lthough I saw dozens of <span class="keywords">street art</span> pieces in the curated <span class="places">Dreamers Tunnel</span>—a place for street

        within the context of pro-immigration and anti-<span class="keywords">wall</span> themes in the space. The first image (<a href="#fig24">Figure 24</a>) shows a demon character. On the top of the head are the distinguishing characteristics: a
        swooshed yellow head of hair signifying <span class="people">President <span class="keywords">Trump</span></span>’s likeness, and two tall horns rising out
        of the hair, solidifying this figure as a demon or the devil.</p>
        <div class="img_article" id="fig24"><div class="art-deco-image"><img src="../images/devil.png"></div>

            </p>
        </div>
        <p>The second (<a href="#fig25">Figure 25</a>) shows <span class="keywords">Trump</span> as a small, rounded cartoon character, hiding behind
        some large illegible text (again, probably an artist’s signature) that is styled similarly to the El Paso paintings of <span class="keywords">Trump</span> with cinderblocks feature in the lettering. The cartoon character holds
        two halves of a torn white paper that reads “DACA” and above his head are the stamped and stenciled words spray painted in red that read “DACA VOID.” Situated as a short character,
        he looks up at the “DACA VOID” text and beyond that to two large portraits of young female  Dreamers. He is shown as creepy and conniving as he leers at the two young women with a malicious grin.</p>

        <p>
            The large figure in the center of the mural is a depiction of <span class="people">Donald <span class="keywords">Trump</span></span>, identifiable by his royal blue suit jacket and red
            tie (one of his consistent outfits as candidate and president). His head has been rendered in the form of a pyramid with a single red eye, and painted in
            a bright straw-gold yellow as a signifier of <span class="keywords">Trump</span>’s most widely recognized physical attribute, his
            hair color and style. His clothes also include a red band around his upper arm with a white circle and black dollar sign, and the tip
            of his tie drapes over the cement <span class="keywords">wall</span> he is on and features a circled star in red. Only his torso
            is showing and outstretched to both sides are his arms. His right hand (showing Caucasian skin different from his all-yellow head)
            clutches an anthropomorphized tree/woman. She has been uprooted by <span class="keywords">Trump</span> and is being moved towards the other side of
            the <span class="keywords">wall</span> where other uprooted trees lay on the ground with blood around them. <span class="keywords">Trump</span>’s left
            hand lets go of one such tree wearing a graduation cap and holding a diploma as they are dropped headfirst on what is
            assumed to be the Mexican side of the <span class="keywords">border</span>.

            </p>
        </div>
        <p>Another key component of the painting is the continuation of <span class="keywords">Trump</span>’s body becoming the <span class="keywords">wall</span>. His legs and lower body are replaced by the <span class="keywords">wall</span> as it
            blockades the <span class="places">US</span> from <span class="keywords places">Mexico</span>. Off in the distance on the right side, the Mexican side of the

            loose boulders and smaller rocks which turn into monarch butterflies as they fly away from the <span class="keywords">wall</span>. Newly formed monarch butterflies in this image resiliently reside as larger mature version
            on the US side of the <span class="keywords">wall</span>, while only one butterfly is shown on the Mexican side of the <span class="keywords">wall</span>. The US side features lush green grass and the horizon shows a city skyline; on the Mexican side, the
            ground is yellow and tan, with only the <span class="keywords">wall</span> on the horizon.</p>
        <p>This is a mural rich with details, symbolism and meaning. The central theme is a monster violently
            displacing people, families, and communities. Further, race is explicit in the figures. <span class="keywords">Trump</span> has
            light, white-skinned hands that contrast to the dark brown color of the tree people. The trees
            signify natural flourishing of human life and contrasts starkly with the unnatural, stone and iron
            humanoid caricature of <span class="keywords">Trump</span>. The <span class="keywords">border</span> <span class="keywords">wall</span> is clearly a violating presence for the entire
            landscape, though monarchs arise gracefully out of its construction.</p>
        <p>The final <span class="keywords">Trump</span> piece in the <span class="places">Long Beach</span> sample is a streamlined mural of <span class="keywords">Trump</span> as the 
            clown <span class="people">It</span>, based off of characters and content from the 2017 release of a remake of the horror film It.
            <span class="keywords">Trump</span>, like the title character of <span class="people">It</span>, is wearing a clown’s outfit with a ruffled, layered neck piece,
            and his face is painted in white with two red lines drawn from his red lips up over his cheeks
            and into his forehead. The lines subtly become the shape of horns as the reach his forehead. His
            expression is a determined scowl, and he, like most of the children behind him, gaze directly at the viewer.</p>

        <h3 class="mt-3 index">PLACING STREET ART IN THE REPERTOIRE OF CONTENTION</h3>
        <p><span class="firstLetter">T</span>his CARGC Paper investigates how ideas are exchanged and protest happens on the <span class="places">US-Mexico <span class="keywords">border</span></span>
            through the medium of <span class="keywords">street art</span>. Problematic media narratives from national outlets about the region and immigrants garner pointed responses from street artists who offer
            their own definitions of the <span class="keywords">wall</span>, women, people of color, and the broader culturally hybrid
            region of the <span class="keywords">border</span>. Rhetoric from <span class="people">President <span class="keywords">Trump</span></span> is outright incendiary for street artists
            and the direct responses to and references of <span class="keywords">Trump</span> in the borderland <span class="keywords">street art</span> scene state
            compellingly exactly what they think of him. After searching five locations in the <span class="keywords">border</span> region
            for immigration, <span class="keywords">border</span> <span class="keywords">wall</span>, <span class="keywords">border</span> region and <span class="keywords">Trump</span>-related <span class="keywords">street art</span>, a sample of thirty-one
            pieces of art and text was collected. Ten pieces explicitly reference or depict <span class="people">Donald <span class="keywords">Trump</span></span>,
            while the remaining twenty-one had content referencing local people of the <span class="keywords">border</span> region,
            political figures, immigrants, or sentiments about the <span class="keywords">border</span> <span class="keywords">wall</span>. All were analyzed for their denotative, connotative, and intertextual meanings.</p>
        <p>Some themes, styles, and content were repeated across the five sites where <span class="keywords">street art</span> was found.
            First, all of the <span class="keywords">Trump</span> depictions were painted intending him to be viewed negatively by the art’s
            audience. Second, cultural references from other media genres (for example, popular television
            shows or historical photographs) were borrowed and infused into the content of the art. Third,
            with the addition of hashtags, some of the art from each site assumed their audience would
            be at least partially, if not fully, virtual. Additionally, there is consensus across all sites that the
            <span class="keywords">border</span> <span class="keywords">wall</span> is an unwanted presence, women and people of color are depicted with grace and
            autonomy, and <span class="keywords">Trump</span> is an impish fool at best, and a tyrannical predator at worse.</p>
        <p>The US-Mexico international <span class="keywords">border</span> is nearly 2,000 miles long and is the site of a unique
            region. Another name for the area colloquially used is “the borderlands,” being neither solely
            northern <span class="keywords places">Mexico</span> nor the southwest United States. Two countries and two cultures meet over
            hundreds of miles and several <span class="keywords">border</span> “sister” cities making the area distinct. The people there
            are prone to view history in the immediate vicinity of both sides of the <span class="keywords">border</span> as equally their
            own. Put another way, El Pasoans describe landmarks and the history of Juárez as part of their own regional pride, and vice versa, citizens of Juárez mourn the <span class="keywords">wall</span> because it obstructs them
            to the full extent of the place, peoples and region they call home. The borderlands is home to a hybrid culture, and is, as the street artists convey, an area misunderstood by promulgators of a
            larger more extensive <span class="keywords">wall</span>, increased <span class="keywords">border</span> patrol personnel, and immigration bans.</p>
        <p>In <span class="places">Juárez</span> and <span class="places">Tijuana</span>, Mexican citizens cannot vote for American politicians, including the US
            president, and so if they oppose the policies affecting their <span class="keywords">border</span> communities, they must turn
            to other methods to get their voices heard. Likewise, undocumented immigrants living in <span class="places">El Paso</span> and <span class="places">Southern California</span> cannot exercise their franchise and vote for legislators who represent
            their interests. While the street artists painting on the American side perhaps have the right to vote, their artwork represents those that do not have that right, and so may use the genre of
            the voiceless. If they, or their allies, desire to oppose politically powerful figures publicly they
            must turn to means other than voting, and <span class="keywords">street art</span> has become a vibrant and novel tool in the
            repertoire of contention for borderland communities.</p>
        <p>The practice of <span class="keywords">street art</span> is stealthy, resilient, non-violent, clever, reactive, proactive, and usually
            illegal. Reactively, it takes ownership of labels about an array of people and ideas (immigrants, <span class="people">Latinos</span>, women, and the <span class="keywords">border</span> region, to name a few) and reorients powerful or widespread
            negative rhetoric towards authentic and defiant self-representation. <span class="murales">Laughing Girl</span> of <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>,
            <span class="murales">Borderland Aliens</span> in <a href="#fig8">Figure 8</a>, and the women of four different nationalities in Figure 23 are all
            examples of this in practice. Proactively, <span class="keywords">street art</span> works to confront those who mislabel, while
            diffusing and dismantling the power that harmful rhetoric can have. The <span class="murales">monarch butterfly</span> of <a href="#fig18">Figure 18</a> (a beautifying symbol of migration) plays with dominant ideas about the “American 
            Dream” and reroute those ideas to more general, humanist dreams of peace and equality, irrelevant of country or place. 
            The <span class="murales">portraits of Mandela and Guevara</span> in <a href="#fig1314">Figures 13 and 14</a> reinforce those claims.</p>
        <p><span class="keywords">Street art</span> is in conversation with mainstream media, presidential rhetoric, and its physical
            environment, and it “talks back” to its surroundings in the public forum of the street. The genre
            of <span class="keywords">street art</span> assumes infrastructure can have imbalances of power and gets to work protesting
            it, on multiple fronts and scales, by interacting visually with it, resurfacing urban furniture, and
            diverting the power of larger forces. A pedestrian crossing the <span class="keywords">border</span> bridge in <span class="places">El Paso</span> looks
            down to view the infamous <span class="keywords">border</span>, but instead sees <span class="keywords">Trump</span> painted as an imbecile. The content
            can be playful, serious, agonizing, tragic, angry, and a host of other emotions present in all art, but it is made what it is because of the smelly, dirty, trashy, shadowy, sewage-filled, gritty,
            and local places they inhabit. The sub-cultural and resistant nature of <span class="keywords">street art</span> messages is
            diminished when these factors are taken out of the equation and only interacted with virtually on
            a screen, but first and foremost <span class="keywords">street art</span> anywhere is an assertion of autonomy and a rejection of dominance.</p>
        <p>From this study’s sample, the genre of <span class="keywords">street art</span> can be seen as a subversive tool for political
            resistance, an authentic means of self and political representation, and a form of activism for
            flashpoint and ongoing causes. The set of messages this CARGC Paper examines is compelling
            evidence that <span class="keywords">street art</span> needs to be continually valorized and explored in the scholarly
            conversation for its legitimacy as a voice in the public forum (<a href="Landry2017">Landry 2017</a>; <a href="#Young2017">Young 2017</a>) and
            affirmed for its usefulness as a response to forms of oppression (<a href="#Alviso-Marino2017">Alviso-Marino 2017</a>; <a href="#Landry2017">Landry
            2017</a>; <a href="#Peteet1996">Peteet 1996</a>; <a href="#Leventis2017">Leventis 2017</a>; <a href="#MacDowell2017">MacDowell 2017</a>).</p>

        <h3 class="mt-3 index">CONCLUSION</h3>
        <p><span class="firstLetter">I</span>n light of the historic <span class="event"><span class="date">2016</span> election</span> and <span class="keywords">Trump</span>’s focus on immigration and the <span class="keywords">border</span> region,
            I explored a data set of artwork that responded to the racism, xenophobia, and fixation over immigration policies which took the national stage. To gather data for this study, I sought out
            pieces at key symbolic sites of powerful infrastructure along the <span class="keywords">border</span>. Concentrated sites of
            hundreds of pieces of <span class="keywords">street art</span> or text were visited, and therefore, a limitation of this study is
            that not all of the pieces could be evaluated and analyzed. Future research investigating the
            entire set of <span class="keywords">street art</span> and text found at just one of these sites as a content analysis would benefit
            the interdisciplinary field of <span class="keywords">street art</span> studies. A content analysis of all the art and text found at
            highly concentrated sites like <span class="places">Playas de Tijuana</span> or in the <span class="places">cement culvert of Ciudad Juárez</span> would
            further clarify and identify themes and issues specific to local areas.</p>
        <p>Likewise, the collection in this study is from visits that lasted only a few days. Another compelling
            approach to researching <span class="keywords">border</span> <span class="keywords">street art</span> would be a sample gathered over time and within
            the context of key <span class="keywords">border</span> region legislation, policies passed in government, or surrounding
            elections where immigration and the <span class="keywords">border</span> <span class="keywords">wall</span> are central to the candidates, as they were for <span class="keywords">Trump</span> in <span class="date">2016</span>. 
            For instance, after the data for this study was collected, <span class="people">President <span class="keywords">Trump</span></span> visited <span class="places">San Diego</span> to see prototypes of new <span class="keywords">border</span> <span class="keywords">wall</span>s,
            which would be an event likely to incite even more reactive <span class="keywords">street art</span> than what was already there. An effects study of exposure to <span class="keywords">street art</span>
            in person versus <span class="keywords">street art</span> online would also be a productive exploration of the greater value
            and weight <span class="keywords">street art</span> has in the public forum. An additional note of limitation within the data
            collection phase of this study is that there were areas in <span class="places">Tijuana</span> and <span class="places">Juárez</span> that were unfamiliar
            to me (Juárez being of concern for the recent Level 2 travel advisory from the US State Department for Americans travelling there to “exercise increased caution”), and so I could not
            remain in the <span class="places">cement culvert of Juárez</span> long to thoroughly study each piece, nor could I venture
            into every <span class="keywords">border</span> neighborhood in <span class="places">Tijuana</span> to look for <span class="keywords">street art</span>.</p>
        <p>Across all the art in this study, colorful murals and smaller pieces of the American sites in <span class="places">El Paso</span> and <span class="places">Long Beach</span> contrasted with the grittier, smellier, more muted and faded palettes 
            of <span class="places">Juárez</span> and <span class="places">Tijuana</span>. However, the visage of <span class="people">Donald <span class="keywords">Trump</span></span> was always clear, unmistakable, vibrant,
            and unfavorable. Art that referenced the <span class="keywords">border</span> <span class="keywords">wall</span> rejected its legitimacy and protested its
            presence on both sides of the <span class="keywords">border</span>. Finally, text and drawings depicting immigrants and
            immigration amplified their likenesses and gave credence to their experiences. Pro-immigration,
            anti-<span class="keywords">wall</span> and anti-<span class="keywords">Trump</span> <span class="keywords">street art</span> on the <span class="places">US-Mexico <span class="keywords">border</span></span> exists and, in a stunning diversity of
            depictions, agrees that the <span class="keywords">wall</span> is an unwanted presence. Immigrants and regionally important
            figures are worth representing on grand and dignified scales. Most potently and explicitly,
            <span class="people">Donald <span class="keywords">Trump</span></span> is a reviled, mocked and degraded character for street artists who participate in
            the public conversation about the <span class="keywords">border</span> region. <span class="keywords">Border</span> politics affect residents on both sides of
            the <span class="keywords">border</span>, but unless those residents have the right to vote in American elections, activists must
            turn to other means to join the debate about how their region is represented, perceived and
            formed. As a critical tool for participatory citizenship in the US-Mexico region, pro-immigration,
            anti-<span class="keywords">wall</span>, and anti-<span class="keywords">Trump</span> <span class="keywords">street art</span> is a creative and subversive medium, changing rapidly with
            its fusion with the digital world, and provides a voice for protest, representation, and resistance in the borderlands.</p>
