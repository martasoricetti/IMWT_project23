        <h3>The role of street art in East African countries</h3>
        <h4 class="pt-3">
            Street artists around the world have been prominent in depicting issues concerning <span class="keywords">COVID-19</span>, but the role of
            <span class="keywords">street art</span> in public-making during the pandemic is unexplored. Despite burgeoning <span class="keywords">street art</span> scenes in many
            African countries since the <span class="date">early 2000s</span>, African <span class="keywords">street art</span> is relatively neglected in critical <span class="keywords">street art</span> scholarship.
            In response, this paper examines <span class="keywords">street art</span> created during the pandemic in <span class="keywords">East Africa</span>n countries, principally
            <span class="places">Uganda</span>, <span class="places">Kenya</span>, <span class="places">Rwanda</span>, and <span class="places">Tanzania</span>, and explores the ways in which it is engaged in highly distinctive forms
            of public-making. Drawing primarily on qualitative online interviews with <span class="keywords">East Africa</span>n artists creating <span class="keywords">street art</span>,
            and image analysis using online search tools, the paper argues that <span class="keywords">street art</span> in urban areas is attempting to
            create knowledgeable <span class="keywords">publics</span> through countering disinformation about the pandemic, to responsiblize <span class="keywords">publics</span>
            through <span class="keywords">public</span>health messaging and, through community activism, to build resilient <span class="keywords">publics</span>. The paper concludes
            that <span class="keywords">street art</span> is potentially an important tool in tackling the <span class="keywords">COVID-19</span> pandemic in <span class="keywords">East Africa</span>n countries
            due to the proximity, and mutual constitution of, creative practices and <span class="keywords">publics</span>, which emerge from the
            embedding of <span class="keywords">street art</span> within the social spaces of cities and everyday experiences of the pandemic.</h4>

        <h3 class="mt-3 index">1. Introduction</h3>
        <p>This paper explores the role of <span class="keywords">East Africa</span>n <span class="keywords">street art</span> in the creation
        of <span class="keywords">publics</span> during the <span class="keywords">COVID-19</span> pandemic. It has long been recognised
        that the proximity of African artists to their communities, and the fact
        that they use a common language, places them in a uniquely privileged
        position to raise awareness of pandemics, as well as to provoke thought
        and dialogue concerning issues of fear and stigma associated with diseases
        such as HIV/AIDS (<a href="#UNAIDS2007">UNAIDS, 2007</a>; see also <a href="#Marschall2004">Marschall, 2004</a>;
        Nabulime & McEwan, <a href="#Nabulime&McEwan2011">2011</a>, <a href="#Nabulime&McEwan2014">2014</a>). In the context of <span class="keywords">COVID-19</span>, artists
        creating <span class="keywords">street art</span><sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> have been prominent in depicting concerns about the
        pandemic, and have received considerable publicity in global online and
        print news media. Even oft-neglected African <span class="keywords">street art</span> has featured
        prominently in recent global news stories about the pandemic<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>. Despite
        this and burgeoning <span class="keywords">street art</span> scenes across the continent since 
        the <span class="date">early 2000s</span>, academic research has tended to neglect African <span class="keywords">street art</span>. In
        seeking to address this neglect, this paper examines <span class="keywords">street art</span> created
        during the <span class="keywords">COVID-19</span> pandemic in <span class="keywords">East Africa</span>n countries, principally
        <span class="places">Uganda</span>, <span class="places">Kenya</span>, <span class="places">Rwanda</span>, and <span class="places">Tanzania</span>. Inspired by <span class="people">Chinua Achebe</span>'s (in
        <a href="Randall-Tsuruta1989">Randall-Tsuruta, 1989</a>) assertion that art arises out of and is, therefore,
        always in dialogue with its social context, we argue that, in the context
        of the <span class="keywords">COVID-19</span> pandemic, <span class="keywords">East Africa</span>n <span class="keywords">street art</span> is engaged in highly
        distinctive and significant forms of public-making. Moreover, as both a
        public-making process and a social act (<a href="#Baker&Blaagaard2016">Baker & Blaagaard, 2016</a>), we
        suggest that <span class="keywords">street art</span> has the potential to play a significant role in
        shaping responses to the pandemic, particularly in urban areas and
        <span class="keywords">informal settlements</span>.</p>
        <p>In addition to a distinction between the <span class="keywords">public</span> – “a kind of social
        totality” – and a <span class="keywords">public</span>– “a concrete audience, a crowd witnessing itself
        in visible space … bounded by the event or by the shared physical
        space”, <a href="#Warner2002">Warner (2002: 50)</a> outlines a third sense of <span class="keywords">public</span>that “comes
        into being only in relation to texts and their circulation” and “by virtue
        of being addressed”. Drawing on this idea, we approach <span class="keywords">street art</span> as a
        visual text that brings multiple, self-organising and reflexive <span class="keywords">publics</span> into
        being discursively. Geographical research on <span class="keywords">street art</span> has tended to
        focus specifically on graffiti (e.g. <a href="#Brighenti2010">Brighenti, 2010</a>; <a href="#Chmielewska2007">Chmielewska, 2007</a>) –
        a graphic practice of (mostly urban) lettering with sub-cultural ties to
        hip-hop music – and its potential to transgress and redefine normalized
        understandings of both art and space (<a href="#Bonnett1992">Bonnett, 1992</a>; <a href="#Cresswell1996">Cresswell, 1996</a>).
        Consequently, <span class="keywords">publics</span> created through <span class="keywords">street art</span> are often understood as
        counterpublics – alternative <span class="keywords">publics</span> constituted by citizens in marginalised
        positions (Fraser 1990) or subcultures (<a href="#MacDonald2001">MacDonald, 2001</a>).
        However, in <span class="keywords">East Africa</span>n contexts these <span class="keywords">publics</span> are not always
        straightforwardly counterpublics since they are also spaces through
        which the systemic, bureaucratic, political sphere (specifically, in this
        case, government, civil society and <span class="keywords">public</span>health) intersects and intertwines
        with the life world of the <span class="keywords">public</span>(<a href="#Torgerson2010">Torgerson, 2010</a>). Therefore,
        we draw on Stephansen’s (<a href="#Stephansen2016">2016</a>) conceptualization of <span class="keywords">publics</span> to explore
        <span class="keywords">street art</span> <span class="keywords">publics</span> as spaces of pedagogic and political practice, where
        practice extends beyond the production and circulation of the artworks.
        We examine how, in <span class="keywords">East Africa</span>n cities, practice extends into activism,
        knowledge-forming and community-building that are intended to shape
        individual and collective responses to the pandemic. This enables
        consideration of the material, embodied and social aspects of processes
        of public-formation which, in turn, allows a conceptualization of 
        <span class="keywords">street art</span> as more than simply a communication infrastructure, but as a multiple
        constellation of practices that contribute to the making of <span class="keywords">publics</span>.
        In this sense, therefore, we draw on Barnett’s (<a href="#Barnett2003">2003: 9</a>; also <a href="#Barnett2014">2014</a>) notion
        of <span class="keywords">publics</span> as emergent: “more or less durable networks of communication”
        that are brought into existence by the practices of representation that constitute them.</p>
        <p>We use <span class="keywords">street art</span> as a general term to describe art found on ‘streets’,
        defined broadly as <span class="keywords">public</span>throughfares that can be either paved or unpaved.
        Definitions of African <span class="keywords">street art</span> sometimes include graffiti,
        alongside other forms of <span class="keywords">public</span>art, but focus on “more illustrative artworks
        and <span class="keywords">murals</span> rather than lettering, incorporating spray painting,
        stencils, stickers, and paste-ups” (<a href="#Waddacor2020">Waddacor, 2020: 265</a>). Our analysis of
        <span class="keywords">East Africa</span>n <span class="keywords">street art</span> departs from assumptions that <span class="keywords">street art</span> is “likely
        to be … illegal [and] anonymous” (<a href="#Riggle2010">Riggle, 2010, p. 246</a>) or, at best,
        morally unacceptable and socially undesirable. The incorporation of
        <span class="keywords">street art</span> into urban tourism, branding strategies and gentrification
        means this is no longer always the case in many cities (<a href="#Andron2018">Andron, 2018</a>),
        but in the diverse political, cultural, and urban contexts in which African
        <span class="keywords">street art</span> is flourishing, illegality and anonymity are not always and, in
        many cases, rarely a feature. Focusing on the role that <span class="keywords">East Africa</span>n street
        art has played in constructing <span class="keywords">publics</span> during the <span class="keywords">COVID-19</span> pandemic,
        we suggest that in many instances its moral acceptability and social
        desirability has increased. We also seek to add nuance to recent assertions
        in critical <span class="keywords">street art</span> studies of a widening gap between members of
        the <span class="keywords">public</span>and the exercise of creative practices, driven primarily by
        social media (Bengtsen 2020, in <a href="#Steinfeld2020">Steinfeld, 2020</a>; <a href="#MacDowall2019">MacDowall, 2019</a>). In
        contrast, we argue that in <span class="keywords">East Africa</span>n urban contexts, the siting and
        experiencing of <span class="keywords">street art</span> in the street and the proximity between artists
        and the <span class="keywords">publics</span> they are forming are highly significant, especially in
        <span class="keywords">informal settlements</span> where <span class="keywords">street art</span> proliferates.</p>
        <p>In what follows, we first provide an explanation of the research
        design and methodology used to collect the data informing our arguments,
        followed by a brief analysis of the <span class="keywords">street art</span> scene in <span class="keywords">East Africa</span>n
        countries. The paper then draws on a range of sources and evidence to
        analyse <span class="keywords">street art</span> in diverse <span class="keywords">East Africa</span>n contexts, and its potential for
        public-making during the <span class="keywords">COVID-19</span> pandemic. Our analysis focuses on
        three themes: the possibilities of <span class="keywords">street art</span> for creating knowledgeable
        <span class="keywords">publics</span> through attempts to counter disinformation about the pandemic;
        the ways in which <span class="keywords">street art</span> attempts to responsibilize <span class="keywords">publics</span> through
        <span class="keywords">public</span>health messaging; the relationships between <span class="keywords">street art</span> and community
        activism, and the role this seeks to play in creating resilient,
        socially engaged <span class="keywords">publics</span>. Finally, the conclusions reflect on the significance
        of <span class="keywords">street art</span> in <span class="keywords">East Africa</span>n countries in <span class="keywords">public</span>formation during
        the <span class="keywords">COVID-19</span> pandemic. Pandemic-related constraints on research
        methods limit the claims we can make about the influence of <span class="keywords">street art</span>
        on informing and responsibilizing citizens. However, we suggest that
        <span class="keywords">street art</span> is highly visible in attempts to tackle the pandemic, especially
        in <span class="keywords">informal settlements</span>, and anecdotal evidence from artists suggests it
        has some influence because of the proximity, and mutual constitution of,
        creative practices and <span class="keywords">publics</span>, which emerge from the embedding of
        <span class="keywords">street art</span> within the social spaces of cities and everyday experiences of
        the pandemic.</p>

        <h3 class="mt-3 index">2. Methodology</h3>
        <p>The research design informing this paper was conditioned by travel
        restrictions and social distancing measures during the <span class="keywords">COVID-19</span>
        pandemic and the ethics of internet-based data gathering, necessitating
        a reliance on publicly available data (<a href="#Kozinets2002">Kozinets, 2002</a>; <a href="#Langer&Beckman2005">Langer & Beckman, 2005</a>).
        <sup><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup>. Consequently, we focused primarily on analysing
        textual, graphic, and photographic data across a spectrum of online
        platforms and channels, identified images of <span class="keywords">COVID-19</span> <span class="keywords">street art</span> in 
        <span class="keywords">East Africa</span>n countries, and subsequently identified and contacted the artists
        who produced them. We worked initially through our existing artist
        networks in <span class="places">Uganda</span> to identify artists, arts organisations, curators, and
        arts publications, and used snowballing techniques to widen our search
        into <span class="places">Kenya</span>, <span class="places">Rwanda</span>, and <span class="places">Tanzania</span>, which have thriving <span class="keywords">street art</span>
        scenes. To obtain a sense of the <span class="keywords">COVID-19</span> <span class="keywords">street art</span> milieu in <span class="keywords">East Africa</span>,
        we immersed ourselves in online discourse via media coverage, conducted
        searches of online African arts journals, <span class="keywords">street art</span> blogs and
        specialist <span class="keywords">street art</span> websites, and followed relevant hashtags on Instagram
        and other social media accounts of individual artists. Online street
        art images have also been captured by photojournalists and used to
        illustrate stories about the pandemic on digital news websites (often the
        same image illustrating multiple stories). Analysis of this imagery and
        narrative provided an understanding of the broader global pandemic
        <span class="keywords">street art</span> landscape and facilitated the design of a specific data collection
        strategy relevant to <span class="keywords">East Africa</span>n contexts. Narrowing from this
        breadth, we gathered two more focused tranches of data with which to
        engage in iterative phases of in-depth analysis: image-gathering via
        online search tools and online qualitative interviews with artists in <span class="keywords">East Africa</span>.</p>
        <p>Using three criteria – the image could be evidenced as located in <span class="keywords">East Africa</span>, 
        was created during the pandemic, and referenced <span class="keywords">COVID-19</span> – we
        sourced 38 initial <span class="keywords">street art</span> images for close analysis sourced via a geocontrolled,
        time-limited search (<span class="date">16th March–20th December 2020</span>)
        using relevant Boolean search terms on Google Image. Since there was a
        preponderance of images from <span class="places">Uganda</span>, <span class="places">Kenya</span>, and <span class="places">Rwanda</span>, we next
        examined a total of 120 <span class="keywords">street art</span> works by 68 artists from these countries
        on Instagram, specialist art websites and in media outlets. General
        content and specific iconographic analysis were undertaken of these
        images, along with the identification of thematic associations and
        trends. Between <span class="date">December 2020</span> and <span class="date">April 2021</span>, semi-structured interviews
        were conducted via Zoom or WhatsApp with sixteen artists and
        one photographer involved in producing <span class="keywords">COVID-19</span> <span class="keywords">street art</span> images
        within our data set, plus one curator and an art gallery administrator. Of
        these, eleven participants were from <span class="places">Uganda</span>, three from <span class="places">Kenya</span>, and five
        from <span class="places">Rwanda</span>. Participants were identified through Facebook, Instagram,
        and personal websites, and purposively selected because their
        work focused on <span class="keywords">COVID-19</span> and was visible in social media and, in some
        cases, online news media. The interviews, which were conducted in
        English, explored artistic intent in depictions of pandemic-related images
        and meaning derived from the resulting artworks. Analysis of
        interview transcripts relied on thematic coding and narrative patterning.
        Whereas publicly available images are attributed to specific artists or
        collectives, we have followed best practice guidelines regarding
        protecting confidentiality and anonymity of interviewees when quoting
        them directly. The subsequent analysis explores key themes emerging
        from both the <span class="keywords">street art</span> images and interviews with artists to provide a
        deeper understanding of the social and political significance of
        pandemic <span class="keywords">street art</span> in public-making in <span class="keywords">East Africa</span>.</p>

        <h3 class="mt-3 index">3. Street art in East Africa</h3>
        <p>With the exception of <span class="places">South Africa</span>, where scholars have explored
        politically-motivated, anti-apartheid graffiti (<a href="#Pawłowska2018">Pawłowska, 2018</a>) and the
        use of <span class="keywords">murals</span> in promoting post-apartheid multiculturalism, peace and
        democracy (<a href="Marschall2002">Marschall, 2002</a>), and <span class="places">Northern Africa</span>, where political
        <span class="keywords">street art</span> garnered attention during the revolutionary uprisings of the
        <span class="event">‘Arab Spring’</span> in the <span class="date">2010s</span> (<a href="#Blaagaard&Mollerup2020">Blaagaard & Mollerup, 2020</a>; <a href="#Lennon2020">Lennon, 2020</a>),
        the African continent has tended to be neglected in studies of global
        <span class="keywords">street art</span> (see, for example, <a href="#GanzManco2009">Ganz & Manco, 2009</a>; <a href="#Ross2016">Ross, 2016</a>; <a href="#Schacter&Fekner2017">Schacter & Fekner, 2017</a>; 
        cf.; <a href="#Waddacor2020">Waddacor, 2020</a>). One reason may be that in many
        African countries, <span class="keywords">street art</span> as a form of freedom of expression has not
        traditionally met with tolerance or social acceptance (<a href="#Steinfeld2020">Steinfeld, 2020</a>).
        Ugandan <span class="keywords">street art</span> is constrained by government crackdowns on dissent
        and attempts to control <span class="keywords">public</span>discourse; political <span class="keywords">street art</span> in <span class="places">Kenya</span> is
        banned; Rwandan <span class="keywords">street art</span> is restricted by the country’s sensitive history
        and strict <span class="keywords">public</span>cleanliness laws; social norms in <span class="places">Tanzania</span> associate
        <span class="keywords">street art</span> with vandalism and rebellion. There are few surfaces
        available for <span class="keywords">street art</span>, and artists take considerable personal risks in
        using highly visible areas and <span class="keywords">public</span>spaces to comment on social ills
        such as poverty, political corruption, or neo-colonialism. Moreover, art
        is taught in few schools and there is little government support. Consequently,
        artists tend to be self-taught and:</p>
        <p>… stick to the slums, because in the slums, you can paint anything,
        it’s free, like nobody’s gonna come and ask you why you are painting
        graffiti … In the CBD you require the permit from the metropolitan
        office, or the county government office. You have got to pay a huge
        amount of money …, you have to talk to too many people. (Interview
        male artist, <span class="places">Nairobi</span>, <span class="date">23/02/21</span>)</p>
        <p>Creating <span class="keywords">street art</span> usually requires support from arts-based nongovernmental
        organisations (NGOs) and permission from authorities,
        communities, and residents. Most of our interviewees are full-time artists
        involved in underground hip-hop movements and <span class="keywords">street art</span> activism.
        Most rely on small-scale commissions from friends, informal businesses
        such as matatu (minibus) drivers, and communities. Some receive support
        from voluntary, non-profit organisations like Breakdance Project Uganda. 
        As <span class="keywords">COVID-19</span> spread, some artists took risks to paint <span class="keywords">murals</span> on
        thoroughfares to advertise their talents and attempt to secure work:</p>
        <p>The main reason for making that mural was to demonstrate a sample
        work to the [Ugandan] Ministry of Health to get a contract making
        <span class="keywords">murals</span> around the country, passing on COVID information to create
        awareness. (Interview male artist, <span class="places">Kampala</span>, <span class="date">23/02/21</span>)</p>
        <p>In some cases, this worked, but reliance on commissions risks cooptation
        of this supposedly insurgent aesthetic through processes of
        ‘artwashing’ (<a href="#Schacter2014">Schacter, 2014</a>), especially when linked to international or
        government funding. Efforts to boost creative economies have generated
        some opportunities in <span class="keywords">East Africa</span>, and global media and tourism are
        important influences on the cultural field and symbolic capital (<a href="#Bourdieu1996">Bourdieu, 1996</a>) 
        of <span class="keywords">street art</span>. However, our research suggests that <span class="keywords">East Africa</span>n
        <span class="keywords">street art</span> is being reshaped and legitimized largely by artists
        themselves and flourishing mainly through grassroots empowerment
        projects seeking to connect <span class="keywords">street art</span> to social justice movements. As
        Zambian artist, <span class="places">Take</span>, argues,</p>
        <p>Most communities in <span class="places">Europe</span> and <span class="places">America</span> are saturated with graffiti
        and the negative connotations that precede it, but in <span class="places">Africa</span> we as
        artists have the unique opportunity to mould perceptions of how it
        will be initially perceived. We can use graffiti as a positive tool to
        uplift communities. (in <a href="#Waddacor2020">Waddacor, 2020: 38</a>)</p>
        <p>We argue that the roots of these shifts lie in what <a href="#Mbembe2013">Mbembe (2013)</a>
        refers to as uniquely African attributes: multiplicity – the profusion of
        cultures, knowledges, world-views and philosophies that characterise
        African societies; circulation and mobility – the context of cultural experiences
        in which almost everything is always on the move; and,
        composition – the idea that African lives are compositional and relational,
        for example in the ways in which the economy is lived on an
        everyday basis or people relate to one another.</p>
        <p>Profusion of cultures, circulation and mobility ensure that <span class="keywords">street art</span>
        is a “travelling modality” (<a href="#Blaagaard&Mollerup2020">Blaagaard & Mollerup, 2020, p. 7</a>) in 
        East African countries. Peripatetic South African artists have been influential
        in the growth of graffiti and <span class="keywords">street art</span> in <span class="keywords">East Africa</span>, especially in <span class="places">Zambia</span>
        and <span class="places">Kenya</span> (<a href="#Waddacor2020">Waddacor, 2020</a>). <span class="keywords">Street art</span> has existed in <span class="places">Kenya</span> for over
        twenty years, but because of parochial stigmas, remains a mostly underground
        movement in which approximately 30 artists engage (<a href="#Waddacor2020">Waddacor, 2020</a>). 
        It draws on the tradition of spray painting matatus, which
        emerged in the <span class="date">1960s</span> with airbrush and vinyl artworks painted on vehicles
        to attract customers. First generation Kenyan graffiti artists credit
        monthly <span class="event">WaPi (Words and Pictures) events</span>, originating in <span class="places">Nairobi</span>’s
        underground hip-hop movement in <span class="date">2006</span>, for building national and international
        artist networks and advancing spray painting as an art form
        (ibid.)<sup><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup>. <span class="people">WaPi</span> received funding and performance space from the British
        Council as part of a programme to support the development of a creative
        economy in <span class="places">Africa</span>, but those involved view <span class="people">WaPi</span> as a tool of social
        justice. As one of its founders claims, it “has taken many young people
        off the streets and has created a great future for them. That’s social
        justice” (<a href="#Mbasu2014">Mbasu 2014</a>). <span class="event">WaPi peace concerts</span> were a feature of
        <span class="event">anti-government protests during the <span class="date">2008</span> political upheavals in <span class="places">Kenya</span></span>
        and “gave young people a sense of pride that wasn’t there before” (ibid.).
        WaPi encouraged collectives such as <span class="people">Bomb Squad Crew</span>, who have
        initiated projects such as <span class="event">Spray for Change</span> and <span class="event">Kibera Walls for Peace</span> in
        response to <span class="places">Kenya</span>’s challenging political climate, and <span class="people">Graffiti Girls Kenya</span><sup><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup>, who raise awareness of issues affecting women. In informal
        settlements such as <span class="places">Kibera</span>, graffiti is welcomed by residents for bringing
        colour to the community and positive change to the environment, and
        for its positive messaging concerning education, sanitation, peace, and unity.</p>
        <p><span class="keywords">Street art</span> styles also travel through digital platforms, and African
        artists use mobile phones to copy styles and circulate their own artworks.
        However, many of the artists we interviewed discuss the challenges
        they face because of shortages and the expense of modern
        technologies and art supplies. For example, spray paint is expensive,
        especially in landlocked countries, and there are difficulties in accessing
        modern spray paints even in <span class="places">Kenya</span>. In response to these challenges,
        <span class="keywords">street art</span> pioneers have adapted and innovated. Renowned Kenyan artist
        <span class="people">Bankslave</span>, for example, burns a hypodermic needle into the can nozzle
        to enable him to create finer lines (<a href="#Waddacor2020">Waddacor, 2020, p. 54</a>), and other
        artists describe mixing spray paint with roller paint to make it easier to
        use. Such innovations, grounded in the compositional nature of
        everyday life, have created a multiplicity of distinctive styles, and
        inspired a new wave of contemporary muralism that <a href="#Waddacor2020">Waddacor (2020)</a>
        claims, alongside fashion, music and science, places Africa at the
        vanguard of artistic expression.</p>
        <p>Everyday challenges may provide one reason why <span class="keywords">street art</span> in 
        <span class="keywords">East Africa</span> is also highly collaborative, rather than competitive and rivalrous
        as it is in other parts of the world. For example, <span class="keywords">street art</span> emerged in
        <span class="places">Uganda</span> as part of a wider urban art movement centred around hip-hop
        in the <span class="date">2000s</span>, especially in <span class="places">Kampala</span> and <span class="places">Gulu</span> (<a href="#Waddacor2020">Waddacor, 2020</a>). First
        generation artists, such as <span class="people">Xenson</span> and <span class="people">Mos Opten</span>, inspired and collaborated
        with new artists like <span class="people">Sparrow</span>, who began painting in <span class="date">2011</span>.
        <span class="people">Sparrow</span> and <span class="people">Mos Opten</span> founded the <span class="event">Kampala Afri-Cans Street Art Festival</span> 
        in <span class="date">2017</span>. While more established <span class="keywords">street art</span> festivals in North
        Africa have been accused of ignoring or marginalising local talent in
        favour of international artists or famous "names"<sup><a href="#fn6">6</a></sup>, Afri-Cans features
        prominent and upcoming urban artists from <span class="places">Uganda</span>, <span class="places">Kenya</span>, <span class="places">Tanzania</span>,
        <span class="places">Rwanda</span>, and <span class="places">Zambia</span>. It is sponsored by local and international
        not-for-profit arts-based collectives such as <span class="people">Afrika Arts Kollective</span>
        (<span class="places">Kampala</span>) and <span class="people">Sanaa</span> (<span class="places">Adelaide</span>), and has generated international interest,
        with some artists securing successful art residencies in Europe
        following exposure at the Festival. Its footprint across the region is also
        expanding, with events in <span class="places">Kigali</span> in <span class="date">2019</span> organised around the theme of
        "The Power of Women"<sup><a href="#fn7">7</a></sup>. One of the founders describes Afri-Cans as a
        culmination of vision to bring together artists to share knowledge,
        empower young Africans, encourage unity and collaboration, while
        strengthening the community and creating <span class="keywords">street art</span> with the power to
        effect change (interview male artist, <span class="places">Kampala</span>, <span class="date">25/02/21</span>). This
        commitment to collaboration and social change is rooted in the origins
        of many artists in impoverished neighbourhoods, and their passion for
        breaking down barriers, engaging at grassroots levels, and inspiring
        others to use art to address social problems. It has also been an important
        factor in the burgeoning <span class="keywords">street art</span> scene during the <span class="keywords">COVID-19</span> pandemic,
        and the prominence of artists as role models and influencers within local
        communities.</p>

        <h3 class="mt-3 index">4. Street art and pandemic publics</h3>
        <p><span class="keywords">Publics</span> emerge from the multiple ways in which individuals and
        communities express themselves (<a href="#Baker&Blaagaard2016">Baker & Blaagaard, 2016</a>). <span class="keywords">Street art</span>,
        grounded in physical spaces and concrete relations, is one medium
        through which this expression takes place and, in the context of
        <span class="keywords">COVID-19</span>, has become an important form of citizen media through
        which <span class="keywords">publics</span> are formed. In <span class="keywords">East Africa</span>n countries, with often poor
        communications and <span class="keywords">public</span>health infrastructures, high rates of illiteracy,
        and cultural preferences for oral and visual forms of
        knowledge-making, <span class="keywords">street art</span> is an important means by which people in
        marginalised communities have sought to engage in social and political
        life. It has become an important mode of communication during the
        pandemic. While authorities often do not tolerate <span class="keywords">street art</span> as a transgression
        of physical space, in some countries the wider arts are now
        being recognised through state-sanctioned projects. In <span class="places">Zambia</span>, for
        example, <span class="people">Modzi Arts</span> was founded in <span class="places">Lusaka</span> in <span class="date">2016</span> and works with the
        <span class="people">Southern African Development Community</span> to promote and expand the
        contemporary arts scene as an important element of social development<sup><a href="#fn8">8</a></sup>.
        Elsewhere artists are working creatively within political constraints
        to forge alliances with or create subaltern <span class="keywords">publics</span> (<a href="#Blaagaard&Mollerup2020">Blaagaard & Mollerup, 2020</a>) 
        in ways that are tolerable to authorities, or at least
        elude their notice. For example, many have formed collectives supported
        by community-based and non-governmental organisations, and it
        is their artworks – usually in the form of <span class="keywords">murals</span>, large in scale and
        depicting scenes of everyday life – that have proliferated in <span class="keywords">public</span>spaces
        during the pandemic. Often endorsed or commissioned by organisations
        and governments, this <span class="keywords">street art</span> is legitimated and afforded access to
        specific locations and buildings. However, it retains its radical edge
        through “its insistence on occupying <span class="keywords">public</span>space” already occupied by
        the state, private enterprises and/or the police, “sparking <span class="keywords">public</span>
        discourse, creating a new <span class="keywords">public</span>” (<a href="#Blaagaard&Mollerup2020">Blaagaard & Mollerup, 2020, p. 3</a>). As
        discussed subsequently, it also affords opportunities for expressions of resistance and subaltern positioning.</p>
        <p>Governments and <span class="keywords">public</span>health advocates around the world have
        stretched the concept of ‘the <span class="keywords">public</span>’ – in terms of both people and space
        – in policies and recommendations to stem <span class="keywords">COVID-19</span> transmission. In
        <span class="keywords">East Africa</span>n countries, <span class="keywords">public</span>health is equally as entangled with sociopolitical
        questions, not least because infrastructures are fragile. Governments
        have adopted pandemic response measures that are also
        entangled with issues of compliance, surveillance, and security,
        providing an important backdrop against which <span class="keywords">COVID-19</span> <span class="keywords">street art</span> has
        emerged. The Ugandan government imposed a strict lockdown <span class="date">between March and May 2020</span>, including a 45-night curfew from March 30th,
        with some easing of restrictions in the summer. Political tensions concerning
        the <span class="event">2021 national election</span> coincided with the pandemic, and
        even the use of facemasks, which the government encouraged people to
        wear in <span class="keywords">public</span>from the summer of 2020, was politicised (<a href="#Anguyo2020">Anguyo, 2020</a>). 
        The Kenyan government imposed strict lockdowns in <span class="date">March 2020</span> and again in <span class="date">March 2021</span>. The Rwandan government imposed a
        strict lockdown <span class="date">between March and May 2020</span>. In April it made
        mask-wearing outdoors in <span class="keywords">public</span>compulsory, and reintroduced lockdown
        measures in six districts of <span class="places">Kigali</span> in <span class="date">June 2020</span> and again during
        winter. All three countries were praised for the initial measures they
        took to curb the spread of the virus, but all have been accused of human,
        civil and/or political rights abuses. The social and economic costs of
        preventative measures have been especially high among already marginalised
        populations. Stringent measures such as closing borders,
        compulsory quarantine, closing schools, and banning <span class="keywords">public</span>transport
        and the sale of non-food items at open markets were effective, but had
        dire consequences for the most economically marginalised, children and
        the sick, who were unable to access medicines and healthcare (<a href="#Akumu2020">Akumu, 2020</a>; <a href="#Wafula2020">Wafula, 2020</a>).</p>
        <p>While new virus variants and slow vaccine roll-out threaten to
        reverse trends, <span class="keywords">East Africa</span>n countries experienced a slow-moving,
        sometimes stalling rate of infection and a comparatively low death toll
        during <span class="date">2020</span>. Scientists have speculated about the reasons for this, which
        may include prior experience with infectious diseases such as Ebola,
        youthful populations, and timely government responses, including
        border controls, travel bans, enforced social distancing measures and
        mask-wearing (<a href="#Maeda&Nkengasong2021">Maeda & Nkengasong, 2021</a>). However, one overlooked
        factor is the possible role of <span class="keywords">street art</span> in creating pandemic-aware
        <span class="keywords">publics</span>, especially in <span class="keywords">informal settlements</span>. As <span class="people">Achebe</span> (in <a href="Randall-Tsuruta1989">Randall-Tsuruta, 1989, p. 224</a>) 
        argues, art arises out of its social context and is
        always in dialogue with that social element:</p>
        <p>Art has a social purpose [and] art belongs to the people. It’s not
        something that is hanging out there that has no connection with the
        needs of man [sic]. And art is unashamedly, unembarrassingly …
        social.</p>
        <p><span class="people">Achebe</span>’s assertion is borne out in our analysis of <span class="keywords">COVID-19</span> <span class="keywords">street art</span>
        in <span class="keywords">East Africa</span>n countries, which reveals the deep ties between <span class="keywords">street art</span>
        movements and community-driven projects for social change and justice.
        As Rwandan artist <span class="people">Bonfils Ngabonziza</span> explains, “My goal is not to
        become famous, but to use arts as a vehicle for positive change and see
        my work have a lasting impact on society” (in <a href="#Arslanian2015">Arslanian, 2015, n.p.</a>).
        <span class="keywords">Street art</span> is powerful because it enters into a conversation with the
        surrounding society in which it produces political <span class="keywords">publics</span> (<a href="#Cresswell1996">Cresswell, 1996</a>). 
        The commitment of artists to collaboration and social change,
        their ability to engage at grassroots levels, and their desire to use art to
        address social problems, have been important factors in public
        engagement concerning the <span class="keywords">COVID-19</span> pandemic. In what follows, we
        explore examples of how <span class="keywords">East Africa</span>n <span class="keywords">street art</span> has attempted to produce
        knowledgeable <span class="keywords">publics</span>, for whom pandemic prevention measures
        are normalized and celebrated as enactment of responsibility which, in
        turn, may help to build resilient <span class="keywords">publics</span> oriented towards social justice.</p>

        <h4 class="mt-3 index">4.1 Knowledgeable publics and countering disinformation</h4>
        <p><span class="keywords">Public</span>health messaging in <span class="keywords">East Africa</span>n countries about the
        pandemic is complicated by a competing mix of interpretations, and
        claims to legitimacy, by diverse actors including the state, the Church,
        civil society, and the public. As <a href="#Ogola2020">Ogola (2020)</a> argues, this has given rise
        to divergences in the interpretation of the disease and multiple narratives
        about the pandemic, particularly online, which can in turn divert
        attention away from the crisis. In some countries, this problem is compounded
        by the undermining of trust in <span class="keywords">public</span>health messaging by
        governments “following years of official misinformation practices”
        (ibid.: 441). This results in ambivalence amongst <span class="keywords">publics</span> sceptical of
        governments whose sole interest lies in controlling the message. For
        example, government data on the number of <span class="keywords">COVID-19</span> infection and
        mortality rates have been questioned through social media in <span class="places">Kenya</span>,
        <span class="places">Tanzania</span>, and <span class="places">Uganda</span>. An Ugandan artist claims that infection rates
        were deliberately under-reported by the government: “they are still
        high, they’re just not being reported, they are hiding things” (interview
        female artist, <span class="places">Kampala</span> <span class="date">08/02/21</span>). Disinformation has circulated
        claiming that <span class="keywords">COVID-19</span> affects only white and rich people, is spread by
        mosquitoes, or is cured by alcohol.</p>
        <p>In response, volunteers, activists, and health organisations have set
        out to create knowledgeable <span class="keywords">publics</span> by disseminating accurate information
        about the pandemic, and artists have played a prominent role in
        these efforts. As a member of the <span class="people">Wachata Crew</span>, a team of urban artists
        in <span class="places">Tanzania</span> that painted a large mural promoting mask wearing, explains,</p>
        <p><span class="keywords">Street art</span> plays a big role in <span class="places">Tanzania</span>, especially in matters of
        delivering messages … Much of the population finds it more entertaining
        and convincing than [TV and newspapers] (in <a href="#Steinfeld2020">Steinfeld, 2020: 102</a>).</p>
        <p>Kenyan artist, <span class="people">Brian Musasia Wanyande</span> (aka Msale) has used 
        <span class="keywords">street art</span> to counter disinformation in <span class="places">Nairobi</span>’s <span class="keywords">informal settlements</span><sup><a href="#fn9">9</a></sup>. His
        <span class="keywords">murals</span> are simple, self-explanatory, and intended to convey facts to
        large numbers of people as they walk past. A series in the high-density
        neighbourhood of <span class="places">Kawangware</span>, painted in collaboration with Nairobi-based
        <span class="people">NGO Health Studio</span> on the walls of <span class="places">Kabiro Human Development Centre</span>,
        warn of disinformation, challenge falsehoods about <span class="keywords">COVID-19</span>
        being spread by mosquitos and affecting only the elderly, and advocate
        preventative measures such as mask-wearing. <span class="people">Msale</span> is concerned
        with illustrating the seriousness of the pandemic, and encouraging
        recommended precautions such as social distancing and handwashing:</p>
        <p>Painting is a powerful way of passing on information … I use simple
        illustrations in my <span class="keywords">murals</span> so that everyone can understand them –
        from young children to the elderly. The importance of my painting is
        to educate the masses about the … virus. I use it to make sure I
        impact my communities positively by disseminating the correct
        information<sup><a href="#fn10">10</a></sup>.</p>
        <p>This commitment to an ethical relatedness with multiple communities
        is apparent in a striking mural created by <span class="people">Mutua</span> in collaboration
        with <span class="people">Mathare Roots Youth Initiative</span>, of which <span class="people">Msale</span> is also a member
        (<a href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a>), which communicates the message that ‘<span class="keywords">COVID-19</span> is real,’ while
        also referencing <span class="people">CGHRD</span> (Coalition for Grassroots Human Rights Defenders
        – a social movement of grassroots social justice activists),
        ‘Feminists Fighting,’ and ‘Africans fighting against <span class="keywords">COVID-19</span>’. This is
        one of several examples of <span class="keywords">street art</span> in <span class="places">Kenya</span>’s <span class="keywords">informal settlements</span> in
        which a politically tolerable message about the pandemic is interwoven
        with more radical expressions of resistance and subaltern positioning.</p>
        <p>The collective and collaborative nature of <span class="keywords">street art</span>, as well as the
        proximity of artists to marginalised communities, is central to efforts to
        create knowledgeable <span class="keywords">publics</span> and shape responses to the pandemic.
        <span class="people">Mathare Roots</span>, based in <span class="places">Nairobi</span>’s second largest slum<sup><a href="#fn11">11</a></sup>, is one of
        several community-based, youth-led, <span class="keywords">street art</span> projects in <span class="places">Kenya</span>. Their
        <span class="keywords">COVID-19</span> <span class="keywords">street art</span> initiative was inspired by UN-Habitat training on
        <span class="keywords">public</span>messaging using <span class="keywords">street art</span>, which had been effective during the
        Ebola outbreak in <span class="places">Sierra Leone</span>, and by the graffiti art featured on
        matatus. As with initiatives elsewhere, their <span class="keywords">street art</span> emerges from the
        grassroots and is not officially sanctioned, but seeks to counter widespread
        disinformation about <span class="keywords">COVID-19</span> and mistrust in information from
        authorities<sup><a href="#fn12">12</a></sup>. They have painted seven large-scale <span class="keywords">murals</span> on the walls of
        buildings in <span class="keywords">public</span>spaces around <span class="places">Mathare</span>, including areas close to taps
        and <span class="keywords">public</span>toilets, depicting mask-wearing alongside messages in English,
        Kiswahili and Sheng, the local slang widely used in urban areas.
        <span class="people">Msale</span>’s 2-m-high mural on the side of a water collection point and handwashing
        station depicts a man in a baseball cap wearing a blue surgical
        mask alongside the message ‘<span class="murales">Corona is Real</span>’ (see <a href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a>). A similar
        modern-style mural with the same message depicts a young woman with
        a fashionable afro hairstyle and leather jacket wearing a red and green
        patterned facemask. Another youth-led, community-based initiative in
        Nairobi, <span class="people">Mathare Environmental</span>, has used <span class="keywords">murals</span> to counter disinformation
        and promote handwashing, and claims success in keeping
        infection levels low in <span class="places">Kibera</span> and <span class="places">Muthare</span><sup><a href="#fn13">13</a></sup>.</p>
        <p>These examples capture the ways in which <span class="keywords">street art</span> attempts to
        create knowledgeable <span class="keywords">publics</span> constituted through their participation in
        <span class="keywords">street art</span> discourse. <span class="people">Mbembe</span> (<a href="#Mbembe2016">2016, n.p.</a>) argues that the distinctiveness
        of African art derives from its “capacity to inhabit the commonplace and
        sensible, precisely with the aim of transforming it into an idea and an
        event.” Of all art forms, <span class="keywords">street art</span> is especially ephemeral, evanescent,
        and fugitive, and thus inhabits spaces of essential fragility and vulnerability.
        For <span class="people">Mbembe</span> (<a href="#Mbembe2016">ibid.</a>), this finitude “is the reason why caring and
        nurturing life are the main functions of the arts”. <span class="keywords">street art</span> enacts caring
        and nurturing through the self-organisation of a <span class="keywords">public</span>via discourse that
        implies an orientation to others, openly addressing people who are
        identified primarily as viewers of the <span class="keywords">street art</span> who are not known in
        advance (<a href="#Warner2002">Warner, 2002</a>). In the context of everyday life in which, as
        <span class="people">Mbembe</span> (<a href="#Mbembe2013">2013</a>) argues, everything is compositional, this relationality is
        made and remade through ethical interaction with others, in this case
        through knowledge sharing, countering disinformation, and exhortations
        to take the pandemic seriously. As discussed below, by participating
        in <span class="keywords">street art</span> discourse concerning the pandemic, strangers are

        <h4 class="mt-3 index">4.2 Responsibilizing publics</h4>
        <p><span class="people">Mbembe</span>’s (<a href="#Mbembe2016">2016, n.p.</a>) claim that caring and nurturing life are the
        main functions of the arts plays out in the often-close relationship between
        art and <span class="keywords">public</span>health in <span class="keywords">East Africa</span>n countries. This is driven not
        only by the arts (and artists), but also by wider societal understanding of
        their capacities. In the context of the current pandemic, governments in
        <span class="keywords">East Africa</span> have certainly recognised that <span class="keywords">street art</span> is potentially a more
        powerful mode of communication than other media, not only in countering
        disinformation (itself ironic given the role of authoritarian governments
        in spreading disinformation), but also in encouraging
        behavioural changes (<a href="#Tasamba2020">Tasamba, 2020</a>). <span class="keywords">Street art</span> has thus been allowed
        to proliferate during the pandemic because it potentially plays a significant
        role in responsibilizing <span class="keywords">publics</span>. As a member of the <span class="people">Wachata Crew</span> in <span class="places">Dar es Salaam</span> argues,</p>
        <p><span class="people">Wachata Crew</span> stick within the legal framework and try to avoid issues
        that might be contentious and get them in trouble. But that still
        leaves room to cover important issues, including … promoting mask
        wearing when <span class="keywords">COVID-19</span> was first in <span class="places">Tanzania</span>, which was well received
        (ibid.).</p>
        <p>Even in <span class="places">Uganda</span>, where <span class="keywords">street art</span> was severely inhibited by restricted
        mobility, the closing down of space for civil society actors, and widespread
        fear of election violence and police brutality during <span class="date">2020</span>, nonpolitical
        <span class="keywords">COVID-19</span> <span class="keywords">murals</span> appeared in <span class="keywords">informal settlements</span> in cities
        like <span class="places">Kampala</span>. These <span class="keywords">murals</span> are often located in the same areas where
        <span class="keywords">street art</span> has previously been used in social initiatives to raise awareness
        about water and sanitation. They thus tend to be in <span class="keywords">informal settlements</span>
        that lack health infrastructure, specifically in areas where people regularly
        congregate (markets, playgrounds) or visit (toilets, water points),
        and where preventive behaviours such as social distancing, maskwearing
        and handwashing are important. <span class="keywords">Street art</span> is thus enrolled in
        community-based attempts to establish these preventative behaviours as
        accepted practices in contexts in which there is no prior mask-wearing
        tradition, where hand-washing and social distancing are very difficult
        due to poor living conditions, but where disease is an everyday reality
        for many people. As one Ugandan artist explains:</p>
        <p>… <span class="keywords">public</span>art influences how people think. So many people from
        ghettos are not exposed to formal communication, so it was a great
        source of awareness to people in the community. Perhaps more
        people put on masks after observing the mural. As a <span class="keywords">public</span>artist, I
        feel that I’m a community informer. (Interview, male artist, <span class="places">Kampala</span>
        <span class="date">25/02/21</span>)</p>
        <p>In <span class="places">Rwanda</span>, street artists have collaborated with <span class="people">Kurema Kureba Kwiga</span> (To Create, To See, To Learn)<sup><a href="#fn14">14</a></sup> – a <span class="keywords">public</span>arts social enterprise
        that brings together contemporary Rwandan artists and community
        stakeholders and uses <span class="keywords">street art</span> to highlight social issues – to create
        awareness about health protocols to stem the spread of <span class="keywords">COVID-19</span>. Early
        in the pandemic, a group of 14 artists painted <span class="keywords">murals</span> across Kigali to
        encourage proper wearing of masks as an everyday norm rather than
        simply a mandatory requirement (interview male artist, <span class="places">Kigali</span>, 
        <span class="date">09/04/21</span>). For example, one mural in <span class="places">Kiyovu</span> (an upmarket area in <span class="places">Nyarugenge</span>
        District of <span class="places">Kigali</span>) depicts a young scholar (<a href="#fig3">Fig. 3</a>) and an older man both
        wearing masks next to bottles of hand sanitizer<sup><a href="#fn15">15</a></sup>. Another in <span class="places">Gikondo</span> (a
        mixed income neighbourhood in <span class="places">Kigali</span>), by <span class="people">Jim Rolland</span>, depicts a
        masked woman and blends safety messages (‘Stay Safe’) with cultural
        references (fashionable hairstyle and jewellery) and vivid colour to
        attract attention<sup><a href="#fn16">16</a></sup>.</p>
        <p>The Kigali <span class="keywords">murals</span> are officially sanctioned and thus need to be
        viewed differently to those that have appeared in <span class="keywords">informal settlements</span>.
        While <span class="keywords">COVID-19</span> prevention may be a relatively benign topic, there is still
        potential for co-optation of <span class="keywords">street art</span> into national narratives, especially
        in <span class="places">Rwanda</span> where <span class="keywords">street art</span> is otherwise strictly prohibited<sup><a href="#fn17">17</a></sup>. In contrast,
        in <span class="places">Uganda</span> and <span class="places">Kenya</span> where initiatives have emerged from the grassroots,
        the potential of <span class="keywords">street art</span> to responsibilize <span class="keywords">publics</span> lies in the
        proximity of artists to the communities in which they work, and its
        ability to ground preventative measures in the social and cultural
        practices and realities of affected communities 
        (<a href="#VanderWesthuizen2020">Van der Westhuizen, Kotze, Tonkin-Crine, Gobat, & Greenhalgh, 2020, p. 4</a>). For example,
        women feature prominently in artworks in <span class="keywords">informal settlements</span>,
        perhaps because they are more likely to congregate in the spaces where
        <span class="keywords">street art</span> is located and most often engaged in the day-to-day tasks
        captured in the artworks; women may also be assumed to be more
        receptive to health-related messaging, and influential in modelling
        responsible behaviours in families and communities. As one Ugandan
        artist explains:</p>
        <p>Young people most of them they don’t see the pandemic as an issue
        to them …. Some keep a distance but generally there is a lot of
        complacency around … But the majority of the women do put on the
        masks in the marketplace [and] in taxis. (Interview male artist, <span class="places">Kampala</span>, <span class="date">09/02/21</span>)</p>
        <p>As discussed, there is also a strong youth presence among the artists
        and collectives, and in the art itself, related to the presence of young
        people in groups or activities tailored to community building or social
        justice initiatives. Much of the messaging is designed to appeal to young
        people and to tackle complacency. As a Kenyan artist explains:</p>
        <p>I like children being around me, the children will be like “yo look at
        the person which has been painted over there, he, she is wearing a
        mask, let’s go and put on a mask” and they sit there like the whole
        day and even the next day and the coming day until the piece is done
        and they will be having their masks on. (Interview male artist, <span class="places">Nairobi</span>,
        <span class="date">13/04/21</span>)</p>
        <p>Cartoon, comic-strip, and graphic novel-style depictions of coronavirus
        are common. Meanwhile, representations of people tend towards
        realism designed to appeal across generations, depicting ordinary people
        wearing masks and frequently making use of traditional dress and
        fabrics, and fashionable patterns and colours. There is also a collectivist
        tone to the images themselves in that they articulate collective action
        and social responsibility in practices such as mask-wearing and handwashing.</p>
        <p><span class="places">Kenya</span>’s <span class="keywords">street art</span> scene has continued to thrive during the pandemic
        despite lockdowns. This has been driven in large part by self-taught
        artists supported by longstanding community ‘artivist’ initiatives in
        <span class="places">Nairobi</span>’s <span class="keywords">informal settlements</span> such as <span class="places">Kibera</span>, <span class="places">Mathare</span>, <span class="places">Korogocho</span>,
        <span class="places">Githogoro</span>, <span class="places">Mukuru</span> and <span class="places">Huruma</span>, through which artists have engaged
        with communities in the development of public-health messaging. This
        has produced a proliferation of <span class="keywords">COVID-19</span> <span class="keywords">street art</span>, with at least 21
        separate large mural projects in <span class="places">Nairobi</span> and <span class="places">Mombasa</span>, especially in the
        capital’s densely populated <span class="keywords">informal settlements</span> that lack basic infrastructure
        and health care systems. People living in these areas have
        limited or no access to social and mainstream media, which is further
        exacerbated by limited literacy. Mitigation measures to prevent the
        spread of <span class="keywords">COVID-19</span>, such as handwashing, social distancing and physical
        distancing are often impossible, and impoverished people prioritise
        other needs when not persuaded of the importance of using a mask. In
        these contexts, <span class="keywords">street art</span> can be important in raising awareness of health
        and wellbeing issues, with different <span class="keywords">publics</span> responsibilized in subtly
        different ways. For example, <span class="keywords">murals</span> by <span class="people">Wajukuu Arts Collective</span> in
        <span class="places">Mukuru</span>, depicting images of figures in black wearing fashionable
        clothing, trainers, blue surgical masks, and sunglasses<sup><a href="#fn18">18</a></sup>, are designed to
        appeal to young people who might see masks as ‘uncool’, but are
        perhaps less likely to influence a person more concerned about feeding
        their children. In contrast, <span class="keywords">murals</span> in <span class="places">Kibera</span> by <span class="people">Art360</span> – a group of
        young independent artists and activists born and raised in informal
        settlements –depict people wearing masks while going about everyday
        life. In <span class="places">Korogocho</span>, <span class="people">Hope Raisers</span> – a community-based organisation – has
        used <span class="keywords">murals</span> on walls along roads with heavy pedestrian traffic to
        communicate <span class="keywords">public</span>health messages, including to residents with
        limited resources, about the importance of mask-wearing and other
        preventative measures, again depicting everyday activities such as carrying
        food and children playing<sup><a href="#fn19">19</a></sup>. Some of the <span class="keywords">street art</span> in <span class="places">Nairobi</span>’s
        <span class="keywords">informal settlements</span> has also been instigated by individual artists who
        seek funding and permission to paint from individuals and organisations
        in their communities, rather than through collectives:</p>
        <p>I was walking in the streets and not many people have masks. Now
        people they are like “ok, are we looking for what to eat to feed our
        self or are we looking to wear a mask. How can I afford to buy a
        mask?” I was so worried so I decided to take the initiative … Let me
        go out and do something about it, talk to people about it, spread the
        pieces [artworks]. (Interview male artist, <span class="places">Kibera, Nairobi</span>, 12/02/21)</p>
        <p>This artist recruited others in <span class="places">Kibera</span> to “go to just one wall and draw
        something that people will pass there each and every time, and it will be
        in their mind … that they will need to put on a mask.” Artists claim that
        initiatives such as these have been effective because of the presence of
        both artist and artwork in the street:</p>
        <p>Yah, people put masks on … When you do a piece in an area, they are
        able to engage in a conversation with us more: “How could we fight
        this thing? Apart from washing hands, what should we do?” Now you
        advise them: “when you go out put on masks, make sure your child
        puts on a mask” … It’s quite positive, people are listening. (Interview
        male artist, <span class="places">Mathare, Nairobi</span>, <span class="date">24/02/21</span>)</p>
        <p>One Ugandan artist explains the significance of <span class="keywords">street art</span> in responsibilizing
        <span class="keywords">publics</span> through storytelling illustrations that resonate with people:</p>
        <p>The COVID mask really didn’t have a believable narrative to Africans
        and Ugandans. We took long to appreciate what this pandemic was
        … “Why do I have to wear a piece of cloth?” … Now imagine wearing
        a mask, it’s one sign of saying “don’t speak to me”. Then they [the
        government] brought this scary theme ‘tosemberera’ which means
        ‘don’t come close to me’. All those sort of slogans, really, really do
        not resonate with our cultural structure. Our culture’s structure
        really, really entirely believes in speaking. (Interview, male artist,
        <span class="places">Kampala</span>, <span class="date">08/04/21</span>)</p>
        <p>In this context, he argues that <span class="keywords">street art</span> is effective because it “is
        basically utilitarian … that’s why we have a lot of storytelling.”</p>
        <p><span class="keywords">Street art</span> <span class="keywords">murals</span> have depicted pandemic mitigation measures
        through narrative forms to which people in diverse <span class="keywords">East Africa</span>n communities
        can relate and understand. This promotion of individual responsibility
        might be viewed by critics as instigating practices of
        neoliberal responsibilization, transferring responsibilities for managing
        health risks from the state to individuals. <span class="people">Sikka</span> (<a href="#Sikka2020">2020: 6</a>), for example,
        argues that a more effective pandemic response to promoting
        mask-wearing “would include health system [sic] that is well funded and
        sufficiently equipped to treat, test, and support vulnerable populations.”
        However, <span class="people">Sikka</span> accepts that “decades of austerity have made this a
        vanishing prospect in most countries” (ibid.), and the reality is that such
        robust health systems simply do not exist in most <span class="keywords">East Africa</span>n countries.
        In these contexts, <span class="keywords">street art</span> is attempting to responsibilize <span class="keywords">publics</span> and
        protect lives by raising awareness of preventative measures. For some
        people, these measures remain challenging because of extreme poverty.
        However, street artists are aware of this through their connections to the
        realities of life in urban <span class="keywords">informal settlements</span>. As discussed below, the
        strongly collectivist and community-oriented nature of <span class="keywords">street art</span> also
        ensures it retains a measure of radicalism in attempting to create resilient
        <span class="keywords">publics</span> during the pandemic.</p>

        <h4 class="mt-3 index">4.3. Community and resilient publics</h4>
        <p>Feminist and postcolonial conceptualisations of substantive citizenship
        understand citizens not simply as those engaged in political
        participation, but as undertaking ethically grounded activities, in private
        and <span class="keywords">public</span>realms, that are relevant to their lives (<a href="#McEwan2005">McEwan, 2005</a>).
        This idea of a citizen having an ethical, non-instrumental social status,
        distinct from both political and economic participation, makes visible
        spaces of radical citizenship shaped by marginalised groups. Drawing on
        these ideas, <span class="keywords">street art</span> can be understood as citizen-producing in two
        distinct ways. First, street artists themselves “become citizens when they
        engage in practices – perform political or aesthetic acts of citizenship –
        that transform their sense of self and their environment” (<a href="#Baker&Blaagaard2016">Baker & Blaagaard, 2016, p. 13</a>) 
        without any expectation of reward in the form of
        cultural or financial capital. Second, the practices they instigate have a
        life beyond the production and circulation of <span class="keywords">street art</span> in forming
        COVID-aware <span class="keywords">publics</span>, who also perform acts of citizenship such as
        mask-wearing and handwashing, in the interest of the wider community.
        We suggest that pandemic <span class="keywords">street art</span> is not simply performing the service
        of <span class="keywords">public</span>health promotion but is a public-building practice instigated at
        the grassroots by individuals and collectives and engaging “participants
        directly in multiple and grounded ways” (<a href="#Baker&Blaagaard2016">Baker & Blaagaard, 2016, p.14</a>).</p>
        <p>Without exception, all the artists we interviewed express a strong
        sense of belonging to and working in and with communities. For many,
        <span class="keywords">COVID-19</span> awareness-raising through <span class="keywords">street art</span> is interwoven with a
        wider commitment to community-oriented activism, and <span class="keywords">street art</span> thus
        emerges out of and helps create resilient <span class="keywords">publics</span>. For example, an
        Ugandan artist explains his involvement in <span class="keywords">COVID-19</span> <span class="keywords">murals</span>: “I thought
        it was a good idea for the community … It involves the whole community
        …, using art as a voice to the voiceless, those people who cannot
        stand up and speak out” (interview male artist, <span class="places">Kampala</span>, 09/03/21).
        Many of the measures taken to stop the spread of <span class="keywords">COVID-19</span>, including
        producing affordable face masks and disseminating information and
        advice through <span class="keywords">murals</span>, were enacted in <span class="keywords">informal settlements</span> long before
        any involvement of <span class="keywords">public</span>health officials. In <span class="places">Nairobi</span>’s <span class="places">Kibera</span> informal
        settlement, for example, as soon as information began to spread about
        the pandemic tailors began producing affordable face masks, while
        artists simultaneously advocated their use in vivid <span class="keywords">murals</span> on walls and
        other surfaces across the informal settlement:</p>
        <p>Most of the initiatives were started by individuals and implemented
        by the people from the community, people who know the needs of
        the community and are also part of it. The people of <span class="places">Kibera</span> didn’t
        wait for humanitarian aid or outsiders to come and intervene or help.
        In the beginning, they took it on all by themselves. (<span class="people">Otieno</span> in <a href="#Jones2020">Jones, 2020</a>)</p>
        <p>Underpinning many of these efforts is a strong tradition of creative,
        grassroots responses to promoting <span class="keywords">public</span>health in high density neighbourhoods.
        As community activists, many artists are experienced in
        engaging with communities in the development of <span class="keywords">public</span>health
        messaging, using credible and legitimate sources, addressing uncertainty
        quickly and with transparency, distilling information from multiple
        sources, and designing messages to increase understanding, induce
        social responsibility, and empower personal control.</p>
        <p>There is also a strong commitment among artists to use art to build
        resilience by promoting solidarity and hope in marginalised communities.
        For example, a Rwandan artist explains his mural design in
        <span class="places">Kiyovu</span> district of <span class="places">Kigali</span>,</p>
        <p>I decided to show a kid … just … [at] home maybe, and wearing
        mask … Just showing them even if there is a pandemic or a virus, we
        can also live with it, and just do what we are supposed to do … I tried
        to use sky-blue so I could also show how beautiful our lives are …
        (Interview male artist, <span class="places">Kigali</span> 13/04/21)</p>
        <p>Another Rwandan artist explains his mural design encouraging
        people to wear masks by referencing familiar cultural images,</p>
        <p>My message was, like, you can stay with your culture, you can still be
        where you are, but then wearing a mask … We can still be where we
        are, but staying safe and staying strong, you don't have to change a
        lot of things. (Interview male artist, <span class="places">Kigali</span>, <span class="date">09/04/21</span>)</p>
        <p>In <span class="places">Kitui</span>, in <span class="places">East Kenya</span>, <span class="people">David Munyao</span> paints <span class="keywords">murals</span> on buildings of
        people wearing masks, with messages in Kamba dialect, English, and
        Swahili. One example on a corner wall in <span class="places">Kitui Central</span> depicts a woman’s
        face in profile with a headscarf and surgical face mask, balancing a
        green basket of fruit on her head, alongside a cartoon image of coronavirus
        and the slogan "<span class="hashtags">#spreadhopenotfear</span>"<sup><a href="#fn20">20</a></sup>. When asked why artists
        were creating such hope-filled images, another artist explains:</p>
        <p>I think art … makes people feel that as artists we care about them,
        because when the disease striked everyone was like “oh now we are
        in slums the government has abandoned us, we will all die,” but the
        moment they started doing the street pieces people were like “no, the
        artists are trying to tell us something.” So I think the feeling is positive,
        it’s giving people the morale to do what is right. (Male artist,
        <span class="places">Mathare, Nairobi</span>, <span class="date">24/02/21</span>)</p>
        <p>The creator of a mural in <span class="places">Kigali, Rwanda</span> of two smiling faces explains
        its message: “despite all the masks and everything, we can still
        smile … regardless of the COVID” (interview male artist, <span class="places">Kigali</span>, <span class="date">31/03/21</span>).</p>
        <p>While <span class="keywords">street art</span> catalyses hope, it is also enmeshed in structural
        injustice and human frailty, of which many artists are all too aware.
        Several express concern about rising infection rates in poorer communities.
        For example, as one artist explains,</p>
        <p>The other day I saw the numbers have started again increasing …
        because the people are becoming careless, and I cannot blame the
        people, because people have to survive. You look at a point where
        either you buy a mask, sanitizer, soap, or you buy food. You are in a
        dilemma so you choose the only thing that you can survive with,
        which is food. (Interview male artist, <span class="places">Mathare, Nairobi</span> <span class="date">24/02/21</span>)</p>
        <p>This awareness of structural inequality inspires many arts-based
        community activist groups, such as <span class="places">Nairobi</span>-based <span class="people">PAWA 254 Initiative</span><sup><a href="#fn21">21</a></sup>,
        a grassroots non-profit artist organization promoting "artivism".
        <span class="people">PAWA</span>'s strategy is to combine activism and art to address social justice
        and governance challenges by working with artists to develop and
        disseminate art (including street and other visual art, music and spoken
        word), and to create resilient <span class="keywords">publics</span> through conscientizing and
        engaging citizens in social change. Through programmes including
        PAWA Cafes, Open Fridays and Literary Thursdays, the collective seeks
        to popularize artivism as a means through which young people can use
        their skills in socially just transformation. During the pandemic, <span class="people">PAWA</span>
        has partnered with youth and community groups in <span class="places">Nairobi</span> to build
        community resilience through <span class="keywords">street art</span>, including the creation of a
        ‘talking wall’ promoting handwashing and mask-wearing at the <span class="places">Dandora Community Justice Centre</span><sup><a href="#fn22">22</a></sup> (see <a href="#fig4">Fig. 4</a>). 
        This is just one example of community <span class="keywords">street art</span> in <span class="places">Kenya</span> that attempts to intertwine resiliencebuilding
        in <span class="keywords">informal settlements</span> with wider engagement and activism based on artists’ own experiences of injustice in these spaces.</p>
        <p>As <span class="people">Bloch</span> (<a href="#Bloch2020">2020: 2</a>) argues, “Walls are where people have looked for
        centuries to gauge <span class="keywords">public</span>reactions to and personal perspectives on
        major events that cannot be left to those in power to convey.” Both
        governments and civil society organisations are not unaware of this and
        in some cases have sought to co-opt <span class="keywords">street art</span> in efforts to encourage
        resilience during the pandemic. In several <span class="keywords">East Africa</span>n countries, NGOs
        have launched initiatives to provide a platform for artists, including
        those creating <span class="keywords">street art</span>, to sell their works and promote <span class="keywords">COVID-19</span>
        awareness. For example, the <span class="people">Trust for Indigenous Culture and Health</span>,
        a non-profit organization based in <span class="places">Kenya</span>, has launched an initiative to
        create a mobile mural made up of different artworks entitled ‘<span class="murales">Resilience</span>’, which provides economic support to artists while spreading <span class="keywords">COVID-19</span>
        <span class="keywords">public</span>health messages<sup><a href="#fn23">23</a></sup>. In Mombasa, a group of artists was commissioned
        by the County Government and Department of Trade, Tourism
        and Investment to design large-scale <span class="keywords">murals</span> to create awareness of
        precautionary <span class="keywords">COVID-19</span> measures, encourage resilience, celebrate
        leadership and thank health officials. They were also designed to let
        tourists know that <span class="places">Mombasa</span> was still open for business. The <span class="keywords">murals</span> were
        painted on walls of high-rises in <span class="places">Buxton</span> (a middle-class residential area
        in central <span class="places">Mombasa</span>), the <span class="places">Coast Provincial General hospital</span>, 
        and <span class="places">Star of the Sea School</span><sup><a href="#fn24">24</a></sup>. One mural on the side of a building features the
        Swahili proverb Umoja Ni Nguvu (Unity in Strength) and depicts several
        masked figures including healthcare workers and police officers. In the
        foreground is a cartoon depiction of a universe with planets and, at the
        centre, a virus particle encircled by a pair of white gloved hands; surrounding
        both and symbolizing hope are sunflowers. Another enormous
        image on the same building depicts a medical professional in blue
        scrubs, medical mask and gloves cradling an image of the Kenyan flag in
        the shape of the country against her chest. The text below reads: "We'll protect you"<sup><a href="#fn25">25</a></sup>.</p>
        <p>On the one hand, this co-optation by civil society and governments
        could be considered a de-radicalisation of <span class="keywords">street art</span>. Critics argue that
        institutional endorsement can have a deadening effect, leading to
        “muralization and touristification of streets and surfaces” (<a href="#Andron2018">Andron, 2018, p. 1037</a>) and an evacuation of radical politics from <span class="keywords">street art</span>
        (<a href="#Abaza2013">Abaza, 2013</a>). On the other hand, however, co-optation in <span class="keywords">East Africa</span>n
        countries confirms the importance of <span class="keywords">street art</span> in creating resilient
        <span class="keywords">publics</span>. These <span class="keywords">publics</span> share similarities with, for example, the counterpublics
        in Brazilian favelas that have emerged through social movement
        <span class="keywords">street art</span> to diffuse the World Health Organization’s
        recommendations and counter <span class="people">president Bolsonaro</span>’s campaign to
        minimize the impact of the pandemic (<a href="#Pleyers2020">Pleyers, 2020</a>). Co-optation also
        signals official recognition of the talent and popular appeal of artists
        creating <span class="keywords">street art</span>. Moreover, artists have seized opportunities to shore
        up their own resilience by showcasing their work, publicising their
        skills, and making a living during a pandemic in which <span class="keywords">public</span>spaces and
        economies have been locked down. As one Rwandan artist explains, the
        pandemic has presented opportunities for strategic positioning regarding government funding priorities,</p>
        <p>We were helping the government to mobilize to prevent the COVID,
        so it was our initiative, and we say you know we can do this and we
        help. The government is investing in creative industries, so we show
        them that we’re here and we can do something to help. (Interview
        male artist, <span class="places">Kigali</span>, <span class="date">31/03/21</span>)</p>
        <p>Some artists, therefore, are willingly co-opted if it means their own
        economic survival, as well providing them with opportunities to use
        their skills for the benefit of their communities.</p>

        <h3 class="mt-3 index">Conclusions</h3>
        <p>This paper has sought to address the relative neglect of African 
        <span class="keywords">street art</span> in existing critical <span class="keywords">street art</span> research through a focus on <span class="keywords">street art</span>
        created in <span class="places">Uganda</span>, <span class="places">Kenya</span>, <span class="places">Rwanda</span>, and <span class="places">Tanzania</span> during the <span class="keywords">COVID-19</span>
        pandemic. In common with <span class="keywords">street art</span> everywhere, <span class="keywords">East Africa</span>n <span class="keywords">street art</span>
        is highly creative, visually striking, and extraordinarily skilful. However,
        because painting can be risky, it is rarely illegal (cf. <a href="#Riggle2010">Riggle, 2010</a>).
        Street artists need to navigate complex terrain, with their work sometimes
        sanctioned by authorities or commissioned by NGOs as a form of
        citizen media and <span class="keywords">public</span>health messaging. There is a risk, therefore, of
        co-optation and ‘artwashing’ (<a href="#Schacter2014">Schacter, 2014</a>), especially when linked to
        international or government funding aimed at boosting creative economies.
        However, much of the pandemic <span class="keywords">street art</span> we encountered,
        especially in <span class="keywords">informal settlements</span>, is co-produced with communities and
        emerges from grassroots empowerment projects seeking to connect
        <span class="keywords">street art</span> to social justice movements.</p>
        <p>Significantly, our research suggests that making sense of pandemic
        <span class="keywords">street art</span> in these contexts requires understanding its presence in the
        shared, ignored, practical, and political spaces of the ‘street’. This departs
        from recent studies of <span class="keywords">street art</span> that claim that, with the advent of
        digital platforms, it is no longer experienced in person, but “rather
        through images on social media” (Bengtsen 2020, in <a href="#Steinfeld2020">Steinfeld, 2020: 202-3</a>; 
        see also <a href="#MacDowall2019">MacDowall, 2019</a>). In contrast, in <span class="keywords">East Africa</span>n cities,
        <span class="keywords">street art</span> is a creative practice always embedded within the social spaces
        of streets (<a href="#Hardy2020">Hardy, 2020</a>). While some artists we interviewed source
        inspiration from and share their designs on Instagram and other social
        media platforms, the siting and experiencing of <span class="keywords">street art</span> in the street
        remains paramount, especially in <span class="keywords">informal settlements</span> where <span class="keywords">street art</span>
        proliferates. Moreover, we argue that <span class="keywords">street art</span> is potentially important
        in tackling the pandemic precisely because of the proximity, and mutual
        constitution of, creative practices and <span class="keywords">publics</span>. While it is increasingly
        sanctioned through social movements, social enterprises, and even
        governments through collaborative creative practices and occupation of
        space, it remains a creative practice embedded primarily within the
        social spaces of cities. Consequently, both sanctioned and unsanctioned,
        <span class="keywords">COVID-19</span> <span class="keywords">street art</span> in <span class="keywords">East Africa</span> is always in dialogue with the realm of
        everyday experiences of the pandemic.</p>
        <p>The paper has also illustrated ways in which <span class="keywords">East Africa</span>n <span class="keywords">street art</span> as
        a social act is a public-making process and, through visual discourses
        and socially shared spaces, the <span class="keywords">publics</span> it seeks to create are multiple,
        self-organising and reflexive (<a href="#Warner2002">Warner, 2002</a>). Like <span class="keywords">street art</span> everywhere,
        “instead of delighting merely the refined sensibilities of an elite few” it is
        a practice that “has the power to engage, effortlessly and aesthetically,
        the masses through its manifest creativity, skill, originality, depth of
        meaning, and beauty” (<a href="#Riggle2010">Riggle, 2010, p. 243</a>). <span class="keywords">East Africa</span>n <span class="keywords">street art</span> is
        notable for its collaborative and collective nature, with a strong youth
        presence in the artworks, and in the individuals and collectives that
        produce them. Youth, <span class="keywords">street art</span> and community are intertwined in these
        contexts because young people are already engaged in collective community
        building and social justice initiatives. The <span class="keywords">publics</span> created by
        pandemic <span class="keywords">street art</span> are thus spaces of pedagogic and political practice,
        where practice extends beyond the production and circulation of street
        art (<a href="#Stephansen2016">Stephansen, 2016</a>). For example, <span class="keywords">street art</span> and the artists producing
        it have sought to encourage people to embrace care for and responsibility
        towards self and others by making and wearing masks
        where there is no precedent for this; to maintain social distancing protocols
        in the most overcrowded of city spaces, contravening norms that,
        as one Ugandan artist argues, are profoundly “social and communal [in]
        nature” (<span class="people">Kayem</span> in <a href="#Mukholi2020">Mukholi, 2020: n.p.</a>); and, to engage in handwashing
        where possible, despite the challenges of often negligible or extremely
        poor sanitation provision. We suggest that in the context of <span class="keywords">COVID-19</span>,
        <span class="keywords">East Africa</span>n <span class="keywords">street art</span> goes beyond providing a communication infrastructure
        for <span class="keywords">public</span>health messaging in areas of cities where this is
        fragile and, instead, seeks to enable the emergence of knowledgeable,
        responsible, and resilient <span class="keywords">publics</span> through multiple practices and networks
        of communication (<a href="#Barnett2003">Barnett, 2003</a>) brought into existence by
        artistic practices of representation that constitute them. Although it has
        not been possible to assess the impact of <span class="keywords">street art</span> on <span class="keywords">public</span>behaviour,
        anecdotal evidence from the artists involved suggests that at the very
        least it encourages conversation and, in some cases, influences responses.
        <span class="keywords">Street art</span> is thus potentially influential in the self-organisation
        of <span class="keywords">publics</span> and countering an otherwise immobilising sense powerlessness
        in the face of a pandemic that governments and <span class="keywords">public</span>health systems
        have struggled to contain.</p>
        <p>Studies of artists involved in <span class="event">HIV/AIDS awareness campaigns</span> in <span class="places">South Africa</span> during the <span class="date">1990s and early 2000s</span> found that very few saw
        their role as direct <span class="keywords">public</span>health messaging. As Marschall (<a href="#Marschall2004">2004: 167</a>)
        argues, artists understood themselves primarily as ‘artists’ not as designers
        of educational messages; they saw their artworks “as expressing
        some of their personal feelings about the disease, perhaps presenting a
        different perspective or challenging ways in which the issue has been
        dealt with”. In the context of <span class="keywords">COVID-19</span>, while there is a strong pedagogic
        element to <span class="keywords">East Africa</span>n <span class="keywords">street art</span>, our research suggests that it is
        similarly an expression of personal feelings by artists: concern for
        communities precariously positioned in relation to a pandemic; desire to
        encourage responsibility and care; commitment to challenging disinformation and engaging within communities that are otherwise
        neglected in <span class="keywords">public</span>health messaging. The dominant <span class="keywords">public</span>health
        flavour to the <span class="keywords">street art</span> makes sense given previous experience in East
        African contexts of campaigns targeting HIV and Ebola. Yet, importantly,
        all interviewees identified first and foremost as artists, for whom
        both the street and art have significance. In their artistic practice, which
        some define explicitly as ‘artivism’, they exemplify <span class="people">Achebe</span>’s assertion
        that “An artist is committed to art which is committed to people” (in
        <a href="#Randall-Tsuruta1989">Randall-Tsuruta, 1989</a>, p. 224). The <span class="keywords">COVID-19</span> pandemic has highlighted
        the potential in <span class="keywords">East Africa</span>n countries of everyday creativity in
        the formation of knowledgeable, responsible, caring, and resilient
        <span class="keywords">publics</span> able to protect and nurture the health and wellbeing of citizens
        and communities, even in conditions of extreme structural inequality
        and poverty. The possibilities of this everyday creativity as a resource
        rooted in cultural attributes of multiplicity, circulation and mobility,
        and the compositional and relational qualities of everyday life
        (<a href="#Mbembe2013">Mbembe, 2013</a>), as a resource for creating new <span class="keywords">publics</span>, and even as a
        resource for remaking the African continent, are worthy of further
        research extending beyond the context of the current pandemic.</p>
