            <h2>Art Deco</h2>
            <p>Appearing just before World War I,<b>Art Deco</b> became the dominant artistic style of Europe and America up through the beginning of the World War II. <br>
              It emerged as a deliberate and contrasting response to the elaborate and ornate styles of the preceding <b>Art Nouveau movement</b>.<br> Since Art Deco's influence extended 
              across various disciplines, including architecture, fashion and visual arts, it assumed different forms but all characterized by a visual style that blends <b>luxury</b>, <b>elegance</b>, <b>geometry</b> and <b>modernity</b>. The influence of Cubism and Machine Age is strong in streamlined forms and symmetrical patterns, while The use of bold, contrasting colors and high-gloss materials such as chrome and glass reflects a sense of opulence.<br>
              Art Deco was a truly international style, but its dominance ended with the beginning of World War II and the rise of the strictly functional and unadorned styles of modern architecture and the International Style of architecture that followed.</p>

                <h3>Images and Layout</h3>
                <p>Art Deco's influence touched everything from architecture to fashion, but its appearance in posters is especially striking and from there derives the main source of inspiration for the image of the cover page and the contact picture in the footer. <br>
                In the illustration of the cover, the key features of Art Deco that have been emphasized are <b>geometric and bold shapes</b>, <b>big scales</b> and <b>minimalistic forms</b>. In particular, images like <b>A.M. Cassandre's <em>Normandie</em></b> (1935), <b>Robert Mallet - Stevens's <em>St Jean de Luz</em></b> (1928) or <b>Franco Barberis's <em>Candee</em></b> (1929) are almost overwhelming in their presentation of scale, the viewer's feeling is to be dominated by the impressive architectural presence of both the ship and the building, but also by the woman's figure in Barberis's poster.<br>
                For the representation of the skyline in the cover image and also for the choice of the color palette, the straightest reference is <b>Johannes Handschin's <em>Grand Prix Montreux</em></b> (1934), with its rhytmic repetition of hard lines and bold shapes.

               <p>Talking about the contact picture in the footer, the stylization of the figure wants to be a reminder of 
                the poster that <b>A.M. Cassandre</b> designed for the brand Grand Sport in 1925. 
                It seems that the author attempted to use the least number of lines as possible to depict a human face, infact the eye is simply depicted with a dot.
                Here the Art Deco <b>stylization</b> and the typical use of <b>geometric lines</b> is evident.

            <p>Another aspect typical of the Art Deco style was the influence
            of the <b>Egyptian aesthetic</b>, emaphsized by the discovery of King Tut’s tomb in
            1922. At the time the world was obsessed with the Egyptian
            culture and this definitely crept through into
            Art Deco designs. Triangles and pyramid shapes,
            fanning reeds and stylized wings all made their
            influence on architecture, furniture, fashion and
            design at the time.<br>
            In particular, the squared border in the issue page wanted to be a 
            reminder of this Egyptian influence and the main source of inspiration 
            has been the poster <b><em>Hygiene Tentoonstelling</em> (1920) by Pieter Hofman</b>.

            <h3>Color Palette</h3>
            <p> The aforementioned poster had also an important role in the choice of the color 
              palette of the current website's Art Deco style.<br>
              In general, <b>metallic colours</b> evoquing the Machine Age were common in design, especially in graphic design and typography.
              Moreover, rich, <b>vibrant colours</b> were used quite a bit for fashion and decoration, an influence
              that came from the Fauvism art style which was popular in the years 1905-1910. <br>
              However for Urban Scrawl I decided to stick to the following assertion:</br>
              <b><em>"The Art Deco typically contrasted warm tans and pale shades of green and blue either with shiny metals or with accents of strong 'pure' colors — vehement reds, cobalt blues, or golden yellows."</em></b> (The National Trust Guide to Art Deco in America, David Gebhard, Preservation Press, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., NY: 1996
              3. Report, p. 50.).<br>
              So I wanted to accentuate the strike between light, creamy colors, like #ccb688 and #fffff0, and more intense and vivid colors like the burgundy and the bright blue, trying to obtain a sophisticated and elegant composition.

                <h3>Font</h3>
                <h4>Bifur</h4>
               <p>The style of Art Deco type was created by one man – <b>A.M. Cassandre</b>.<br>
                In <b>1929</b>, Charles Peignot, director of the French type foundry Deberny & Peignot, sponsored Cassandre’s experimental new display typeface called <b>Bifur</b>.<br>
                Bifur font combines very thick strokes with thinner horizontal or vertical lines, it is known for its bold and unconventional aesthetic, making it a notable example of Art Deco typography.
                <b>Designed for advertising</b>, it was intended to surprise: its characters do not have the appearance of conventional letters forms and they almost look as if they had been produced by a typographic accident.<br>
                Cassandre created Bifur by simplifying the architecture of the alphabet. He stressed its geometric qualities, eliminated all horizontal lines that were not absolutely necessary and filled in the spaces inside the letters with grey or some other colors.<br>
                To render Bifur instantly legible, Cassandre based his design on sans serifs. Actually one might say that he reinvented the sans serif, breathing new life into it and restoring its original identity by imparting a fresh and vibrant appearance (<a href="https://www.cassandre-france.com/amc-by-henri-mouron" target="_blank">https://www.cassandre-france.com/amc-by-henri-mouron</a>, chapter 2).
               </p>
               <h4>Peignot</h4>
               <p><b>Peignot</b> has been created always by <b>Cassandre</b> in <b>1937</b>.<br>
                Cassandre's quest for a spare and <b>elegant style</b> led him to create Peignot, a typeface intended for various purposes, including book work.
                <br>Cassandre believed in restoring the dignity of the written word by returning to the Roman alphabet and eliminating decorative accretions; he spent years reflecting on the decline of the Roman alphabet, emphasizing the importance of contrast between thick and thin strokes. He argued for the legibility of lowercase letters, proposing a return to classical shapes while preserving ascenders and descenders (<a href="https://www.cassandre-france.com/amc-by-henri-mouron" target="_blank">https://www.cassandre-france.com/amc-by-henri-mouron</a>, chapter 2 <em>Suite</em>).<br>         
                This sans-serif typeface, as envisioned by Cassandre, exhibits a unique combination of differently weighted lines within each letter, showcasing its calligraphic roots. Notably, there is a distinct contrast between the uppercase and "lowercase."<br>
                It has an elegant appearance but at the same time posseses a playful and dynamic quality, thanks to its distinctive combination of "mixed-case" (some lowercase Roman alphabet shapes replaced by capitals) and elongated ascenders and descenders.

            <h2>Punk Flyer and DIY Zine Aesthetic</h2>
            <p>The overall style of the second theme aims to emulate the style of a zine, specifically a <b>punkzine</b> - a small circulation publication closely tied to the punk subculture and hardcore punk music genre.
              Starting in the <b>1970s</b>, the DIY aesthetic of the punk subculture created a thriving underground press. <br>
              A pletora of fanzines emerged during the wave of punk in Britain (1976-79), in a context of substantial cultural, social and political change where punk reacted against the 
              'modern world' and the abstortion of 'hippy culture' into the mainstream. Punk also reacted against the mid-1970s 'hit parade' rock music scene: it was seen as an alternative to the 
              mainstream music industry and a breath of fresh air with its independent and 'do-it-yourself' approach.<br>
              Fanzines adopted the same <b>independent and DIY approach</b> that punk musicians had espoused: they offered fans a free space for developing ideas and a visual space not limited by formal design rules and visual expectations.
            </p>

                <h3>Images and Layout</h3>
                <p>Punk fanzines attempted to capture the exciting, chaotic feel of punk music at the time and recreate it visually.
                  In terms of design, images and illustrations in punkzines are characterized by a <b>do-it-yourself attitude</b>, often featuring black and white photographs, punk symbols like safety pins and anarchy signs, and hand-drawn or collage elements. Layouts are <b>asymmetrical and irregular</b>, 
                  breaking away from traditional design norms. Torn edges, irregular shapes, and overlapping elements contribute to the overall chaotic and rebellious aesthetic. Also Text elements play a crucial role in punkzines, with bold statements, provocative slogans, and a mix of fonts reflecting the anti-establishment attitude.<br>
                  I tried to gather all these elements in the design of the punkzine's inspired cover of the present website: <b>overlapping images with torn edges</b> like if they were cut and paste from other publications, <b>handwritten slogans</b> and the asymmetrical arrangement of the page are just few features of the punk fanzines' diverse and creative layouts.
                  In particular, I took inspiration from the cover of the issue 10 of <em>Panache</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As already mentioned, punk fanzines, emblematic of the DIY ethos, were often crafted by hand and commonly reproduced through inexpensive <b>photocopying processes</b>. The photocopying techniques prevalent during that era introduced distinctive artifacts, including <b>grain, distortion, and rough textures</b>. These inherent imperfections became integral to the aesthetic of the zine, contributing to its authenticity and endowing it with a vintage quality.
                  In an effort to evoke the spirit of these handmade punk fanzines, I made the decision to extend this aesthetic to the entire body of the content. I achieved this by applying an image with a photocopy texture as the background, employing the mix-blend-mode CSS property set to multiply. This specific setting results in a blending effect that multiplies the color values of the element's pixels with those of the underlying pixels in the background.

              <h3>Color Palette</h3>

                The main colors used for recreating the punkzine's aesthetic are shades of black and white, with occasional splashes of neon colors, like for highlighting the metadata in the text to give the idea that an highlighter was used for that. 
                Infact, in the world of punkzines, <b>black</b> is a foundational color that signifies rebellion against societal norms and mainstream conventions. It embodies a rejection of the status quo and an embrace of an alternative, countercultural mindset. While <b>white</b> is like a canvas for creativity, if the black embodies the disruption of the 
                existing conventions and rules, the white is the symbol of the creation of a new world, the expression of oneself personality without adhering to traditional design standards.
                The use of <b>neon colors</b>, mimicking the effect of using a highlighter, not only adds a practical layer to the design, aiding in the organization of information, but also reinforces the hands-on and do-it-yourself approach characteristic of punkzines. It suggests that the zine creator has taken a physical highlighter to the pages, underscoring the tactile and DIY nature of the medium.

            <h3>Font</h3>
            <p>Articles, reviews, and band interviews were often <b>handwritten</b> or <b>typed using typewriters</b>, adding a personal and gritty touch to the content. For this reason, for the most part of the text I decided to use 
            a font that replicates the writing of a typewriter (<a href="https://www.dafont.com/elegant-typewriter.font" target="_blank">Elegant Typewriter</a> by Lukas Krakora). But I modified the font, using an handwritten 'n'
            because I wanted to remind to a particular punkzine, that is <em>Chainsaw</em>, a punkzine edited by "Charlie Chainsaw" and published in suburban Croydon from 1977 to 1984. For this zine, after the 'n' key broke on the 
            editor's typewriter, the typographic treatment mixing an handwritten 'N' with the typewritten forms became a stylised trademark.
            </p>
            <p>For the headings I used <a href="https://www.dafont.com/punk-west.font">Punk West</a> by WOODCUTTER, which looks like <b>ransom note-style typography</b>: letters cut from different sources and pasted together was a popular choice in punkzines for headings and titles.</br>
              Furthermore, for subheadings and images' descriptions the font is <a href="https://www.dafont.com/handwritten.font">Handwritten</a> by Brian Esquivel, that, as the title suggests, is an handwritten font and handwritten annotations, as well as, hand-drawn illustrations, band logos, and punk-inspired graphics were common in zines and contributed to make each copy unique.
